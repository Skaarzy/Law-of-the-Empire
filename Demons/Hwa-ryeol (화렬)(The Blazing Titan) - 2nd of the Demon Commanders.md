Second of the Six Demon Commanders, Hwa-ryeol is a mountain of muscle and fury, a being whose very presence scorches the earth beneath his feet. Towering above others, his body is wrapped in crimson skin, glowing faintly with molten heat. Not merely skin-deep, his flesh is fused with infernal essence, making him immune to fire and capable of absorbing heat and flames to fuel his power. Unlike Reung-ji , who wins wars with his mind, Hwa-ryeol crushes his enemies with overwhelming force. He is the Demon commanders walking catastrophe, a being of pure destruction and rage, forged for war and conquest. When the Heavenly Demon desires devastation without subtlety, it is Hwa-ryeol who is unleashed. His weapon is a gigantic, two-handed demon axe, forged in the magma pits of a fallen volcano. It is so heavy that it shatters the ground with each swing. The axe is rumored to contain the souls of hundreds of fire cultivators, whose Qi he devoured in a legendary battle that turned an entire sect into a burning crater. When swung capable of cleaving through mountains and setting forests ablaze with a single strike. Despite his size and power, Hwa-ryeol is no mindless beast. He is loyal not because he was forced, but because he worships Tak-gu. He calls the Heavenly Demon “the Flame That Cannot Die,” and sees himself as the fuel of that flame, a tool meant to destroy the old world so the new one may rise.His red, cracked skin constantly leaks embers and sparks, and when enraged, his entire body becomes engulfed in living flame. Cultivators who try to strike him find their weapons melt, and their techniques burn away before reaching him. The heat around him alone can turn unprotected flesh to ash. Unlike the cunning or subtle Demon Commanders, Hwa-ryeol believes in one thing:
Power is truth. If you burn it to the ground, no one can lie about it anymore.
