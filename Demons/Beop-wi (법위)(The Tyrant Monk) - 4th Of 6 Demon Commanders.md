_The scriptures promised peace… but I found power in pain."_
The Fourth Demon Commander, Beop-wi was once a high monk of great renown, a master of martial discipline and spiritual wisdom within a powerful monastic sect. But ambition grew in the quiet of his meditations. The desire to transcend death itself poisoned his heart, and his quest for forbidden knowledge led him to ancient, demonic sutras that were guarded, hidden and secluded beneath his temple. When his fellow monks discovered his heresy, they tried to purify him with fire. But Beop-wi did not die. He burned for days cursing them with his screams, and vowed revenge on the heavens themselves.His half-burnt, mummified body was later found by Tak-gu, the Heavenly Demon, who revived him using his own demon blood and dark Qi. What rose was no longer a man of peace, but a corrupted un-dead monk his once pure chants twisted into mantras of torment, his martial forms now crushing and cruel. He believes that the Heavenly Demon gave him true power, and he follows his master without question. In return,Tak-gu gave him freedom to do whatever he wants. Now he is secluded somewhere not living or breathing just siting like a statue and not doing anything unless  Tak-gu asks him to carry out a mission which happened only a couple of times. His new gained power now was the opposite of his past shaolin one now his palm techniques is a poison one and his gaze can turn those who fear him into stone. Speechless but Powerful though he never speaks much, his silent authority is overwhelming. His mere presence shatters the resolve of most warriors. He commands his undead monks with eerie precision, turning them into weapons of war. Undead Forces Beop.wi has control over his undead disciples, whom he raised from the bodies of the monks he killed. These followers are bound by golden prayer beads, unable to disobey him. Their bodies are corpses, but their souls have been corrupted into loyal servants of Beop-wi’s will. Loyalty to Tak-gu despite his corruption, Beop-wi holds a deep respect for Tak-gu.
