_"Death is merely a doorway, and I hold all the keys. Your soul was mine the moment you gazed upon me."_

Seventh of the Demon Commanders and perhaps the most enigmatic, Myeol-hon appears as a figure of refined nobility—his pale, purple-tinged skin and pitch-black eyes giving him an otherworldly elegance that masks a predator's hunger. He speaks with aristocratic grace, his cold demeanor suggesting ancient wisdom and calculated restraint. Yet when provoked, his carefully maintained facade shatters to reveal his true nature: a chilling smile spreads across his features as he prepares to unleash techniques from which there is no escape.

Before his transformation, Myeol-hon was a **Jinbeop-sa** (진법사) - "Formation Master" of the Divine Seal Sect, blessed with incredible talent that even earned him recognition as a genius. However, despite his brilliance in formations and strategic thinking, he lacked the one gift the sect valued above all else—the innate ability to see corrupted energy. The sect master, believing that only those born with this natural gift could truly serve their demon-hunting purpose, constantly dismissed and pushed away Myeol-hon, telling him he "wasn't special" no matter how exceptional his other abilities proved to be. This constant rejection corrupted Myeol-hon with thoughts of inferiority and weakness, his self-worth crumbling under the weight of being deemed inadequate despite his genius. Eventually, he was driven to the very demons the sect hunts—if he couldn't destroy them and gain recognition, perhaps joining them would grant him the power and acceptance he was denied.

During what appeared to be a routine demon hunt, Tak-gu launched a devastating assault that became a complete slaughter of the Divine Seal Sect forces. One by one, Myeol-hon watched his fellow sect members fall until he was the only one left alive, trembling before the Heavenly Demon. What seemed like coincidence was actually carefully orchestrated by Tak-gu, who had been watching the brilliant but broken Formation Master for some time. Recognizing the strategic value of Myeol-hon's knowledge of illusions and formations, Tak-gu had planned this massacre specifically to isolate him. Overwhelmed by despair and terror, Myeol-hon begged for his life. The only reason Tak-gu spared him and made the deal was because Myeol-hon possessed powerful formation techniques and promised to share his mastery in exchange for the power that Tak-gu's blood could provide—the ability to harvest and consume souls to extend his own existence indefinitely.

Myeol-hon's mastery over souls is absolute. He can rip the very essence from living beings, leaving empty shells behind, or force displaced souls back into bodies like a puppeteer with invisible strings. His illusions are so profound that victims believe themselves transported to entirely different realms, seeing phantom figures and false environments so convincing that reality becomes meaningless. As the creator of the Demonic Cave Shield and Illusion Formations—mystical arrays drawn with ancient symbols and letters—he has fortified countless demonic strongholds with defenses that trap intruders in layered nightmares.

Like all demon commanders, his powers stem from drinking Tak-gu's blood, which ironically makes the Heavenly Demon the only being immune to his abilities. Even his fellow commanders fear him, never knowing what twisted fate he might weave for those who anger him. His formations have become legendary among demons and humans alike—intricate patterns that seem to pulse with malevolent life, capable of shielding entire caverns from discovery or ensnaring armies in inescapable illusions.

Yet Myeol-hon cares nothing for conquest or glory. The Heavenly Demon's grand plans are merely convenient distractions that allow him to pursue his true obsession in the shadows. He harvests souls with the patience of eternity itself, each consumed essence adding precious time to his existence. He is content to remain hidden, a specter of nobility who feeds on the very essence of life while the world burns around him, knowing that as long as there are souls to harvest, his immortality grows ever closer to becoming absolute.
