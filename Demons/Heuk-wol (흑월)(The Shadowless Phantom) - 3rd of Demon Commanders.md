The Third Demon Commander, Heuk-wol is a creature of silence and fear a phantom cloaked in shadow and smoke, moving between worlds like a whisper of death. While others roar, blaze, or command armies, Heuk-wol says nothing. His presence is like a cold draft in the dead of night unnatural, unnoticed… until it is too late. He never speaks unless directly addressed by Tak-gu, and even then, his replies are brief, emotionless, and quiet. He does not need to assert his power his mere existence is a constant reminder that death can come without warning, without form, and without mercy. His body is barely physical, surrounded by a dark, flowing mist that seems to drink in light itself. Cultivators say that even in sunlight, his silhouette flickers like smoke, and in battle, he often vanishes entirely. What he leaves behind are corpses cleanly slain, without sound or struggle. His movements are untraceable, and he walks without footprints or scent, making him nearly impossible to track.Only Tak-gu has saw his face. Despite appearing as a mere servant or shadow at the side of other commanders, Heuk-wol is arguably the most dangerous of them all, and the only one who regularly stands near Tak-gu without speaking. Many believe he serves as the Heavenly Demon’s personal executioner, a blade hidden behind the throne. He wields no blade in hand his shadow itself transforms and becomes his weapon, stretching, slicing, piercing, and corrupting. He can melt into the ground, rise behind opponents, or even pass through walls and barriers. It is said his Qi is not alive, but ghostly, impossible to sense until it is too late. Even among demon commander, no one trusts Heuk-wol not because he is disloyal, but because he is too quiet, too still, never sleeps and is faceless

replace actual hands with shadow hands and keep the string but also make them shadow remove one of the sword and make the other a sword made out of a moving shadow that doesn't have the normal shape of a sword but constantly changes its shape and only when it moves can u see the blade like smoke the shadow is delayed, his helmet replace it with the hat like in the above image, his lower drags and cloths should also be shadow and almost flowing around and seeping into the ground making it look like he has no legs and that should merge into his abdomen making it look like the body is fake and the the upper part should have shadow like vein that are thick and moving around and make his eyes black
