Born as a half-deity son of Master Un-mok (Deity of Merriment, Wandering Spirits, and Freedom) and a human woman, form the day he was born he was experimented on by the emperor and certain people form the empire, who tortured and studied him to understand and weaponize his blood thinking it would give them a advantage on the sects and the clans, which twisted his worldview into seeing the most evil done by the most powerful and thinking the world is fundamentally evil and needs to be changed through force. After escaping the emperor and the empire, he gathered eight fellow outcasts who became his generals after drinking his blood and gaining enhanced abilities, and he now leads a cult that uses human experimentation and "demonic" imagery to recruit desperate people, viewing his actions as twisted justice against a world that created monsters through its cruelty and neglect. Has the most powerful telekinesis powers and demon blood (poison blood and can turn others blood into his meaning can drink others blood to prolong his life and increase his Qi) his meridians are different from others because they don't flow and aren't in the from of veins but its just his heart that is a meridian and it crate the qi. And he can make his qi solid and making the so called supreme asura demons that are like spirit puppets he controls but the more of them he makes and the stronger they are it depleats more of his qi. Ruler of all of the demons. Feared by all sects—orthodox, unorthodox, or demonic—Tak-gu is the undisputed ruler of the Demon Path. His name alone is forbidden in some temples, whispered in others as both warning and prophecy. He is not a sage, not a fallen immortal, but something wholly other. Born of blood and will, Tak-gu is a demon whose very existence defies cultivation norms. His Qi is not gathered through meridian flow but created directly by his heart, a unique core that pulses with black fire and venomous intent. His body does not circulate Qi it generates it, raw and furious. He possesses the most powerful telekinesis in existence even that of the emperors is weaker, capable of shattering cities with invisible force or controlling thousands of blades like extensions of his fingers. His blood is corruptive and poisonous, able to infect others from the inside out. When he drinks the blood of enemies, it does not just restore him it turns their life into his, converting their energy into his Qi and prolonging his unending vitality. His most feared technique is the creation of the Supreme Asura Demons solidified Qi beasts shaped by will alone. They are massive, violent, and utterly loyal, controlled like puppets from within his mind. The more he creates, and the stronger they are, the more his Qi is drained. But his enemies rarely last long enough for this to matter. He has no sect, no throne, and no army. But those abandoned by their sects, those discarded by empires, and those who have tasted betrayal all kneel before his shadow. Entire cults worship him as a living god, though he rarely visits. His doctrine is simple: "Power must not beg for permission." He accepts no disciples, but if someone were to gain his interest, it would not be through loyalty or lineage but by surviving his presence and daring to look into his eyes without fear. It is said his katana a black blade with no name once belonged to the first demon he killed. Others say it belonged to the god who tried to kill him. He has never confirmed either. He has 8 so called commanders that offered themselves for him to do with them and command them as he wants.
