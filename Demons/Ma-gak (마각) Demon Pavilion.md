This place is the one and only city of the demons, its the place where the 7 generals and the heavenly demon reside.The city itself has multiple entrances which are hidden with illusion spells and guarded by defensive and shield barriers so not even a grand-master can sense that something is wrong with the mountain.Inside the city its mostly dark and murky with couple of torches and stone lanterns which emit a white and blue fire which is the only thing that lights the city.The structure of the city is mostly like a big cave with rooms and places carved into the walls of the cave , there aren't my demonic humans living there with the heavenly demon and the 7 generals only those inner disciples who can survive and are thought to be worthy of the privilege and every general can pic up to 50 disciples which means the cave isn't small as it seems the 7 generals and the heavenly demon refuse to exit because of their greed and their loyalty to the heavenly demon who orders where to increase their energy and wait until the events he plotted happen and to training and cultivate their disciples as well until the right time comes, the others that visit but can go into the main city but only to the outer are lesser demons who deliver information and necessary things that generals or the heavenly demons ask. Of course the 7 generals and the heavenly demon can exit if they want and they aren't sealed there but they are biding their time .The city is spread through the whole mountain making the mountain a hollow stone of a sorts meaning its was fragile even though it looked powerful.It look like most sect pavilions where there are halls and parts of the city given to every general and the main hall being the heavenly demons main palace, it was built by the heavenly demon himself who sneaked  into the mountain searching for rare herbs but found a hidden cave from which he started building the city from nothing with his bare hands it took him over a century to make it but while he was making it he was also training and cultivating while resting making him that much more powerful the main palace was at the peak almost breaking through the roof of the hollow mountain and the under it are 2 big halls use by the first 2 demon generals and then there are 4 of the rest the 6th demon general refused a pavilion hall for himself in exchange that he can go outside and be the eyes and ears of the heavenly demon so there are 6 actual big pavilion halls in the mountain with many smaller houses and halls for grand disciples and bigger unit hall where the rest of the inner disciples lived together
