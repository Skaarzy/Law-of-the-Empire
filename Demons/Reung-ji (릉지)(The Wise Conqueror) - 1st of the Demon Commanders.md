_"Victory lies not in the strength of the strike, but in the mind that commands it."_
First of the Six Demon Commanders and the most trusted by Tak-gu, Reung-ji stands as the master tactician of the Demon commanders his mind sharper than any blade and more dangerous than any army. He does not need to fight directly, for his genius alone shapes the fate of nations. When the Heavenly Demon needs strategy, it is Reung-ji's hand that guides the world. Before offering his service to Tak-gu, Reung-ji was a renowned warlord of a fallen empire, known for disassembling his enemies not with brute force, but with calculated precision. His mind was his greatest weapon, and he wielded it like an artist, pulling threads of fate that made armies collapse under their own weight. He abandoned his empire after a cruel betrayal, choosing to align with the Heavenly Demon out of fascination with his unstoppable power. In Tak-gu, Reung-ji saw the ultimate variable a force beyond calculation. Reung-ji wields a beautiful, but deadly fan, crafted from blackened metal and silken threads, which symbolizes his calculated approach to battle. The fan, unlike the typical weapon of a general, is an extension of his mind. Each flick of his wrist releases invisible currents of air, carrying hidden blades of Qi that can cut down foes with surgical precision. His true strength, however, lies in his ability to manipulate the battlefield and force opponents into traps they don't even realize exist. But it is not just the battlefield where Reung-ji excels his powers extend to psychic manipulation. With his Mind's Embrace, Reung-ji can implant suggestions or read the thoughts of his enemies. His mind can overwhelm others’ wills, turning their own actions against them or causing them to second-guess their every move. This power makes him a terrifying force he doesn’t just predict outcomes; he bends them to his will.
Reung-ji commands armies, not with fear, but with foresight. He sees battle plans before they unfold, and his followers obey, knowing that every victory is the product of his brilliant mind. He is a planner, a manipulator, and a shadow ruler, orchestrating the rise and fall of empires from behind the scenes. He is the first to kneel before Reung-ji and the one who has never once failed his Lord. While the other Demon Commanders lead their forces into battle,Reung-ji shapes their paths, ensuring that victory is always inevitable. His role is more than that of a leader he is the mind that controls everything. And his fan is not just a weapon; it is a symbol of mastery over fate itself.
