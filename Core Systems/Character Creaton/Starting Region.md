- The player **starts in one of the 5 main clan families**, each with its own distinct martial arts style, techniques, culture, and maybe unique bonuses or game-play flavor.Whichever clan player chooses they will immediately be a high person in the clan not a next in line or a minister or a council member but a famous inner disciple which the maste  of that clan and chooses to teach and like the players opinion
    
- Then, after the tutorial and brief history explanation through story choice, quest, or personal decision—the player can choose to leave their clan and become a anything they want a disciple of another sect, a hunter a blacksmith or a tavern owner and so on gaining access to that specifiy paths ability and sub-quest and even secrete treasure if they reach a high level, spiritual cultivation, and different fighting styles.
    
- This creates great depth: the player’s origin shapes their base skills and identity, but their later sect choice opens new pathways and character growth.
    
- It also fits well with lore, since clans hold regional and practical power while sects offer mystical and spiritual advancement.
