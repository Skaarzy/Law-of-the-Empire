[[REMEMBER]]



**Horse Storage:**
- **Weapons** (visually mounted - that Witcher/RDR2 appeal!)
- **Armor sets** (also visually displayed)
- **Backup/situational items**

**Clean workflow:**
- Most activities use pouch storage (smooth gameplay)
- Only call horse when switching gear or weapons and bows
- Horse follows player around for a few minutes after calling (unless player gets in battle then the horse flees)
- Visual satisfaction of seeing gear mounted on horse

This gives you: ✅ Realistic visual appeal (mounted weapons/armor) ✅ Smooth gathering/crafting flow  [[All UI Systems]]
✅ Strategic gear preparation ✅ No constant horse calling needed ✅ Manageable to code

**Player Pouch:**
- Consumables (healing pills, food, recovery items)
- Quest items
- Currency
- Small tools/misc

**Horse Storage:**
- Weapons (backup weapons)
- Armor (extra armor sets)

**No "bulk overflow" needed** since there are no physical slot limitations - just category-based organization. The pouch and horse storage would be simple lists within their categories.
**Clean and straightforward!** Items just go where they logically belong based on type, not based on running out of grid space.
