DYE & DESIGN SYSTEM — STRUCTURE
**1. Dye Stores (Cloth Armors, Bows and quivers)**
- Found in villages, towns, or sect locations.
- Each store offers a **limited regional collection**:
- ~3–5 designs.
- Unified by **one main color** (e.g., “Red River Village” only carries crimson-based motifs).
- Dyes represent **patterns + color**, not just flat recolors (like Ghost of Tsushima’s patterned armor variants).

- Named elegantly:
- _"Crane in Smoke"_, _"Wind from the South"_, _"Pine Mist Weave"_

### ⚒️ **2. Blacksmiths (Metal Armors & Melee Weapons)**
- Found in martial cities, fortresses, or elite outposts.
- Handle **recoloring & engraving** of:
- Heavy armor (iron, scale, lamellar)
- Melee weapons (swords, spears, sabers)
- Limited to **metallic tones + minimalist inlay** (e.g., gold filigree, black steel, engraved spine)

- Name designs appropriately:
- _"Iron Lotus Edge"_, _"Moonlight Temper"_, _"Obsidian Burnish"_

### 🏕️ **3. Camp/Sect HQ Re-dye Access**
- Allows changing to **already unlocked dyes only**.
- No new purchases, no design previews.
- Just a place for **equipment management and loadout changes**.
- Feels grounded: you're preparing before battle, not dressing up mid-fight.

### 🚫 **4. No Quick Recolor**

- No on-the-fly color swapping.
- No in-menu hex wheels or free-pick options.
- Reinforces **respect for craftsmanship** and **meaningful aesthetics**.

### 🧭 **Fast Travel Integration**

Since you have fast travel, this design won’t frustrate players — they can easily revisit stores to change gear, without breaking immersion.
