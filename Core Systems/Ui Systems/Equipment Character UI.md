*Equipment/Horse UI:**
- Can only be accessed by the horse
- 3D character display with dark background
- Top slot: Bow (can change what bow is equipped)
- Bottom slot: Main weapon (can change what weapon is equipped)
- In between shows equipped skills(cant change them here but sees what each does and what button it uses)
- Stats of armor are display on left side
- Armor Types on The right (can change armor equipped)
- Armor shown visually on character
- **Horse UI Sub UI"s:**
- [[Weapon UI]] (swords, spears, dual weapons, daggers, etc.. with stats shown on the right)
- [[Bow UI]] (types of bows and arrows with stats on the right)

**So Horse UI = gear storage/switching only:**
- See your armor with its current dye
- Switch between different weapons
- Change what you're wearing
- But can't modify the appearance - that's store-only
