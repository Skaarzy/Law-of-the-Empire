**Left side:**
- **Top**: Bow description and stats (damage, draw speed, range, etc.)
- **Bottom**: Arrow description and capacity info (only the equipped arrow)

**Center:**
- **Large bow and quiver with arrows showcase** - shows the equipped bow and the arrows visually

**Right side:**
- **Top**: Bow types selection (Half Bow, Longbow etc... with only unlocked visible)
- **Bottom**: Satchel with arrow icons and quantities (50/30, 29/30, etc.)

**This layout is excellent because:**

- Clear information hierarchy
- Visual bow display in center draws attention
- Easy bow switching on right
- Arrow management with hover details (as you wanted)
- Stats and descriptions logically placed on left

For descriptions only the equipped arrows and bows are show, wiht the quiver having different looks based on the bow equipped.

There are also bow dyes for editing the look of the bow in the dye stores
