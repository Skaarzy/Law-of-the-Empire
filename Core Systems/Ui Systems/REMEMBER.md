✔ Same structure  
✔ Same usability  
✔ Only different backgrounds tied to clan identity

That’s clean, immersive, and respectful of player experience. Solid design call
- **Background represents the “origin spot”** where the player learned their unique Qi technique.
- It visually and thematically matches the clan/sect’s culture and identity.
- When the player selects a clan/sect, the UI background changes to that clan’s special location.
- The background can include **environmental details, symbolic elements, and atmosphere** that hint at the Qi style or clan’s history.
- It enhances immersion without affecting gameplay mechanics directly—purely visual and storytelling.
