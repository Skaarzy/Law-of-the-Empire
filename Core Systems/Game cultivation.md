The Dao is the natural, ever-present essence of the universe—like air—existing everywhere but controlling nothing. It connects all things without imposing rules.

**Deities**  
Deities are supreme spiritual beings embodying fundamental forces or concepts like Time, War, Nature, Death, and more. Each deity has its own unique spiritual realm where they primarily reside. They may occasionally take human form to interact with the mortal world but generally remain within their realms.

**The Strongest**  
Among humans, there are about 30 elite individuals known as **The Strongest**. These individuals possess immense qi and power, far beyond normal humans. They can create, access, and fight within [[Mind Domain 심역 (Sim-yeok)]]  unique to themselves. These realms allow them to train, meditate, and battle without causing massive destruction to the mortal world.

**Normal Practitioners**  
Regular people who cultivate qi and meditate do not possess enough power to form their own spiritual realms. They focus solely on increasing their qi within the mortal plane, training and growing steadily but without access to realms or the vast power The Strongest wield.


The player cultivation is as following :
So the player meditates in the serene room with no UI clutter. When they click on the **table** (or altar, shelf, whatever you choose) holding their potions, pills, or cultivation tools, a small UI pops up showing inventory and options to use or combine items.The player can cultivar wherever but it leaves them vulnerable and weaker than usual.The player can cultivate even when not in game he just need to make sure to be in his house or on his land and the cultivate and exit the game when he reenters their player is in the same place but has gained the cultivation of the hours the player left.For ascending to a higher level in cultivation  the player needs to breakthrough his current level of cultivation.For meridian there will be a ui but they unlock only at a certain level first it the 
basic line of veins flowing trough the body then the higher lever the more branches of veins can be unblocked.
