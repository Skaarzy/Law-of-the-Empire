# Game Time System Design Notes

## Core Time System

**Regional Climate Zones:**
- Each region has permanent climate (mountain=cold, valley=warm, etc.)
- Gradual ambient weather changes within each zone (rain, fog, clear skies)
- No seasonal transitions - saves massive development work

**Time Display:**
- Time only visible during main story quests
- Shows as: "Fall 1520 - The title of chapter" when main quest starts
- No time shown during free exploration periods
- Next main quest: "Winter 1522 - The title of chapter"
	- Years between quests are "nonexistent" for gameplay

## Main Quest System

**Quest Structure:**
- Main quests are chapter-based with specific years/seasons
- When main quest begins: **TIME FREEZES** (season stops progressing)
- Player can explore entire world during main quests
- No new major side quests until the main is complete

**Content Restrictions During Main Quests:**
**POSSIBLE:**
- Basic exploration anywhere in world
- Use shops/merchants
- Gather resources (wood, herbs, materials)
- Simple tasks (hunting, delivery, fetch quests)
- Complete existing complex questlines already started
- Talk to NPCs for world-building

**NOT POSSIBLE:**
- Start NEW major side questlines
- Begin NEW complex multi-step stories
- NEW heist planning, romance arcs, faction quests, etc.

## Quest Availability System

**During Time Freeze:**
- Existing complex quests can be completed
- Simple task NPCs remain available
- Complex quest-giver NPCs don't offer new major quests
- Time remains frozen until main quest completion

**After Main Quest Complete:**
- Time unfreezes
- New complex side quests become available
- Cycle repeats for next main story chapter
