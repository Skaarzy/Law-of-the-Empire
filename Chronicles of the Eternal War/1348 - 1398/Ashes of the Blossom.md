**Part One: The Whispered News**

The morning mist clung to the peaks of Divine Root Province when the news first reached the Song clan compound. Two years had passed since the five clans were cast out from the imperial city, two years of living in the shadow of what they now called the Corrupted Ones. The clans had adapted, grown harder, but they never stopped watching, never stopped hoping for change.
It came in the form of a whisper.
A figure in dark robes and a featureless mask had approached one of the Song clan's outer disciples at dawn, speaking only a handful of words before vanishing like smoke: "The Falling Petal has wilted. The mountain burns."
By midday, the rumor had reached Song clan leader's ears. The Plum Blossom Sect Grandmaster—the legendary Falling Petal Immortal Jang Hwan-so—was dead, killed in brutal combat at his mountain retreat. The very thought seemed impossible. Jang Hwan-so had been untouchable for decades, a pillar of the martial world.
But when the Song leader sent word to verify with the Plum Blossom Sect, the response chilled her blood. The high-ranking disciple she contacted was dumbfounded, racing immediately to find his Sect Master. They knew nothing.
The Plum Blossom Sect Master, renowned for his ice-cold composure, led a small group to the mountain retreat that very day. What they found defied comprehension. The entire eastern face of the mountain was ash and char, a hellscape of black stone and dried blood stretching as far as the eye could see. At the center of the devastation stood the retreat—or what remained of it.
There, planted in the scorched earth like a grotesque banner, was the Grandmaster's own cane sword. Impaled upon its tip was Jang Hwan-so's severed head, eyes still wide with the shock of death.
The Sect Master—a man who had faced demon hordes without flinching—dropped to his knees. His scream of rage echoed across the mountains, and the qi that erupted from his grief was so violent that cultivators in the distant Divine Root Province felt tremors in their cores. For a moment, the mask of cold control slipped entirely.
But only for a moment. When his fury cooled, calculation returned. He ordered absolute silence. No word to neighboring sects, nothing to the empire. The martial world was already fracturing—this news would shatter it completely.

**Part Two: The Confrontation**

His plans crumbled within hours.
The next morning, the Song clan leader stood in the main pavilion of the Plum Blossom Sect, summoned by urgent letter. The moment she entered, killing intent crashed over her like a physical force. Ancient wooden beams groaned and cracked under the pressure. Disciples and guards collapsed where they stood, overwhelmed by their master's barely contained wrath.
The Song leader held her ground, but barely. Sweat beaded on her forehead as she fought to remain conscious.
"How," the Sect Master's voice was winter itself, "did you know before we did?"
Through gritted teeth, she explained. A masked messenger. A third party. Information delivered to their lowest disciples first, designed to spread like wildfire.
As realization dawned, the Song leader seized her chance. "The blood rituals," she gasped. "The markings we've reported. The corruption spreading through our territories—this is connected. You have to see that now."
The Sect Master's killing intent vanished abruptly, replaced by something far more dangerous: focused attention. For the first time, he truly listened to the clans' warnings. The patterns they'd been reporting. The systematic nature of the corruption.
His letters went out that same hour—to all ten heavenly sects, to the imperial court. He demanded an emergency council, cursed the emperor's negligence, and for the first time in decades, showed his hand publicly.

**Part Three: Political Maneuvering**
The response was swift and disappointing. Only three sects voted for the emergency council. The rest, perhaps fearing involvement or simply skeptical, declined. The empire sent flowery apologies and vague promises to "investigate thoroughly."
The Plum Blossom Sect Master had shown weakness by revealing his desperation, and the martial world's politics ground on as always. He dismissed the Song leader with cold courtesy, ignoring her curses and threats as she stormed from his pavilion.
But the empire's follow-up letter carried more substance. They would send the Divine Seal Sect—the emperor's own exorcist specialists and his right hand in supernatural matters—to investigate the scene. It was a compromise that satisfied no one but offered the only path forward.
The Sect Master agreed, with one iron condition: the Divine Seal disciples could observe and investigate, but they would touch nothing. The mountain remained sacred ground, now consecrated as the grave of the Falling Petal Immortal.
As autumn deepened and the Divine Seal investigation began, none of them suspected they were already too late. The true horror of what had killed Jang Hwan-so—and what it meant for the martial world—would not be revealed for months to come.
