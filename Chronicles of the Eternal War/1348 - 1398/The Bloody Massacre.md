The war has begun, and blood flows like rivers across the martial world.

**Part One: The Triple Assault**

The war begins simultaneously across three fronts, catching the empire and sects completely off guard. Years of demonic infiltration and preparation culminate in a coordinated strike that shatters the martial world's defenses in a single, devastating blow.
The Divine Seal Sect's island fortress, supposedly impregnable and dedicated to investigating supernatural threats, becomes the first casualty. Demonic cultists who had infiltrated their ranks over years suddenly reveal themselves during the morning watch, systematically assassinating key defenders and opening the fortress gates from within. Demon ships emerge from the morning mist like phantoms, their black sails billowing with unnatural wind, carrying hordes of corrupted warriors whose weapons drip with infernal fire.
The sect's own investigators, trained to hunt supernatural threats, find themselves facing enemies that exceed their worst nightmares. Creatures that laugh at blessed weapons, beings that regenerate from mortal wounds, and corrupted humans whose strength surpasses any martial artist. The island burns as demons claim it as their naval base, using the sect's own facilities to launch coordinated attacks on coastal territories.

**Part Two: The Underground War**

From the hidden demonic city deep within caves beneath the Heavenly Root Sect's territory, three demon commanders emerge to lead a massive assault on the Heavenly Sword Sect. The yellow-bannered warriors, renowned throughout the empire for their legendary blade techniques, face enemies that mock their steel with claws harder than any metal and infernal weapons that burn through armor like paper.
The attack is merciless and perfectly coordinated. Demons pour from tunnels that had been secretly excavated for months, emerging directly within the sect's inner courtyards and training grounds. Entire generations of sword masters are slaughtered in moments as the demons' supernatural speed and strength overwhelm even the most skilled warriors. The famous Heavenly Sword formations, designed to face human opponents, prove useless against enemies that can leap impossible distances and strike from multiple directions simultaneously.

**Part Three: The Mountain Siege**

Meanwhile, the Emei Sect's mountain fortress comes under siege from demonic forces seeking to claim their ancient techniques and strategically vital position. The all-female sect's legendary defensive formations and weapon mastery face their ultimate test as waves of demons assault their peaks.
The lime-green banners of Emei flutter desperately in the smoke-filled air as the sisters fight to protect secrets that could determine the war's outcome. Their mountain fortifications, built over centuries to be impregnable against human armies, strain under attacks from creatures that can scale sheer cliffs and tunnel through solid rock. Yet the Emei warriors adapt, using their mobility and precision to exploit the demons' overconfidence.

**Part Four: The Emperor's Last Stand**

Strangely, the Plum Blossom Sect remains completely untouched throughout the coordinated assault, their territory eerily quiet while chaos erupts across the martial world. This peculiar immunity raises questions that no one has time to investigate.
As demonic forces converge on the imperial city itself, the 50-year-old emperor faces his greatest crisis. With his armies scattered and his most trusted sects under assault, he makes the desperate decision to activate his final contingency - the 8000 mind-controlled terracotta soldiers he had commissioned in secret.
The mental strain of controlling so many constructs simultaneously pushes the emperor beyond his limits. Though his terracotta army successfully defends the imperial city, the effort destroys him from within. Blood flows from his eyes instead of tears as he watches his empire burn, knowing that his failure to act sooner against the demonic threat has led to this catastrophe.

**Cutscene: The Truth of Jang Hwan-so's Death**

_[Flashback to Chapter IV - The mountain retreat, moments before the discovery]_

The Second Demon Commander, Hwa-ryeol, arrives at the mountain retreat like a walking inferno. Ancient pines begin smoldering from his mere presence, their needles curling and blackening before falling like ash. Stone pathways crack and split from the intense heat radiating off his crimson skin, and the air itself seems to burn around him.

The Falling Petal Immortal, sensing the approaching destruction through his spiritual awareness, initially attempts his legendary redirection techniques. His movements are fluid, graceful, seeking to guide the demon's destructive force away from his sacred retreat. But when his peaceful methods fail against this embodiment of pure annihilation, something awakens in the old master that had slumbered for decades.

For the first time since achieving enlightenment, Jang Hwan-so abandons his philosophy of non-violence.

The battle that follows shakes the mountain to its very foundations. The old master's crooked cane reveals its true nature as a weapon of immense power, channeling decades of accumulated internal energy into devastating strikes that split boulders and carve trenches in solid rock. His famous "falling petal" movements transform into a deadly dance of destruction, each gesture carrying the accumulated weight of his legendary martial past.

Hwa-ryeol's massive demon axe, wreathed in hellfire, meets techniques that had once defeated entire sects in single combat. For precious moments, the demon commander actually struggles against the enlightened master's assault. Jang Hwan-so fights like the wind itself - everywhere and nowhere, striking from impossible angles with movements that seem to bend reality around them.

His internal energy, refined through decades of spiritual cultivation, proves capable of temporarily cooling even Hwa-ryeol's infernal heat. The demon's crimson skin actually dims under the pure, concentrated assault of righteous qi, and his confident laughter turns to grudging respect.

But enlightenment has its limits when facing pure corruption. As the battle rages across the mountain, Hwa-ryeol's demonic essence begins overwhelming the old master's spiritual defenses. The demon commander's philosophy that "Power is the only truth" slowly, brutally, proves itself against even transcendent wisdom.

The final moment comes when Jang Hwan-so, exhausted from channeling power beyond mortal limits, falters for just an instant. With a devastating swing of his demon axe, Hwa-ryeol strikes down The Falling Petal Immortal in a single, crushing blow.

In a display of brutal mockery, the demon commander severs the old master's head and impales it on Jang Hwan-so's own crooked cane - a grotesque trophy that desecrates both the man and his peaceful philosophy. The message is clear: even the most enlightened wisdom falls before absolute power.
