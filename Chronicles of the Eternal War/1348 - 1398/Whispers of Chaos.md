#### **5. Major Events / Plot Progression**

**Part I:**  
Small villages across the 5 clan provinces begin to report mysterious and grisly occurrences to the 5 clans . Murders staged to look like suicides, eerie disappearances, and sightings of strange figures unsettle the populace.Ar this stage most ignore these because the 5 clans were know for being poor and having a bad economy so most thought it was lies and people trying to get attention, so the clan councils just put it aside because it was just a normal thing for beggars to die and suicides and disappearance were also common as well as shady figures so the clan just went on as normal. 

- Baek clan experienced human bodies in water and on the shore and far in the sea there was a puddle of blood mixed with sea water so most thought it was a ship that got pierce by a reef and the crew got eaten by sharks (where the blood puddle is add sharks and floating human remains ) of course hey investigate but didn't find anything strange so it was just written down and people moved on.
- - The Song clan, known for their assassins and information networks, begin to notice dead bodies turning up and strange contracts being placed on ordinary beggars. Simultaneously, the black market rapidly dries up—rare items are bought in bulk by unknown buyers using hooded middlemen. There’s growing suspicion that the powerful and secretive Black Forest Assassins are involved, having both bought the items and placed the contracts. However, since the Black Forest are feared and not considered direct rivals, the Song clan decides not to interfere or investigate, wary of provoking something beyond their control.
- Yu clan being hunters were known explorers and wanderers so them find unusual stuff is nothing new the thing that confused them was the tree rotting where a weird insignia was placed so they were the only one that started to investigation this as its in their forest that trees became rotten, but in the end even the masterful hunters couldn't find the culprit or culprits they thought it was probably a type of poison that someone was experimenting with and they did send a letter to the empire but more as a report than a concern.
- Jang clan know for reading people and knowing what one wants so them noticing weird and sketchy people wasn't out of the normal but the only weird thing was the eyes which almost glowed with a blood red color which sent chills down the performers spine and even weirder they usual didn't even listen to the performance but were there almost recruiting people and usual leaving before the show finishes with a couple of normal people with them
- Hwan clan had the weirdest thing for them happen which didn't happen in decades large number of debts were all of a sudden gone and big debts for over half of millions appeared and when they went to investigate nothing was found not a paper of proof of giving the debt or the person who received it this sent the hwan clan in a almost rage , they used all of their resource even called for the imperial guard to come search and if by accident they would find one of the debtors he would just kill himself with a pill that made his mouth foam so in the end they did send letters to the other clans especially to song for a request to put bounties on those who disappeared and almost seem like they don't exist but no rash decision were made

**Part II:**  
Every one of the 5 clans did have conflicts and some even alliance with eachother so there were pressures and more important things to worry about than the weird things happening the
- Baek clan focused on making alliances with hwan and song and keeping the yu clan far away as possible they dint like them for yu being free and strategies fighter know for laying trap and waiting for pray to come and hiding but luckily there were no escalations along with the jang clan who they also considers cowards for hiding and fighting with poisons and hidden weapon. But for baek clan the most important thing was that the fishing season began so most villager were on their boats fishing and trading fish for other resources this year was also the first year in decades that the clan leader went on a fishing trip as well even though it was out of boredom most know they wont be disappointed by his catch ,last time he went out to fish out of boredom he caught a whale just so he can prove his skills didn't get rusty 
- Jang clan focused on building their relationship with  yu and living freely as the always do, the ones who had conflict with them the jang clan didn't care about, it was song and hwan that didn't like song clan because of their nature and they way they earn a living but jang clan just lived to survive and live as free as they can be they didn't have a exact location for their main capital so that was their main goal of finding a place to settle and finally build a city with a bustling economy until now they live of the donations and payments from other provinces and taverns for their performance
- Yu just lived their own lives as they wanted because the weren't near the other clans so they didn't have a big worry on conflict but they did have clans they supported and there was one clan they disliked and the only reason for this dislike was because the other clan disliked them as well it was the baek clan who were know to pass by with ships near their province almost provoking them even though the yu clan could be bothered by them, all the other clans they liked and supported with whatever they needed, their mayor thing was the next major yearly tiger hunt which they prepare through the whole year and only a select number of warriors can be go hunting in the tiger regions of the forest and mountain , there were time when even important imperial individuals would come and watch its usual a big party as well with the leader of yu telling stories of the animal pelts which he hunted himself.
- Song clan was in a little bit of a mess because of the other assassin sect black forest who were a unorthodox sect meaning can use qi but song clan could do anything about them as the black forest assassins were levels above them in strength stealth and information,s other song clan focused on making their black market their main source of income and the clans main interest winch didn't prove easy especially when the ware would almost empty out , the conflicts and alliance didn't matter much to song because if they don't like one of the clans they could just blackmail them, but the conflicts were with hwan mostly and they didn't like jang but that was more of a disgust of their way of live than anything else the conflict with hwan was more dangerous because they didn't have much blackmail on them so they could do anything to them if they wanted to attack, and their allies were all that can pay them anybody can be their ally no matter their connections
- Hwan clan was also in disarray because of the missing debts and new one that appeared out of nowhere their reputation was on the line so most of the clans council meeting were about what to do and how to handle this it was a urgent matter as the imperial minister of revenue Lee Hye-shin was coming to do the annual tax report for the empire which if he find out that something is wrong could cause the alliance between empire and hwan to turn into a conflict so all of the hwan clan member were scattering around trying to make sense of thing , on the other hand there was the banquet that must be prepared for the imperial minister of revenue which was a massive banquet with a lot of money spent on it,their conflicts were with song and  jang which was mostly because hwan considered them not acting as a clan should but they supported yu because yu helped them with escorts and trade routs as well.
**Part III:**  
While the Empire’s main alliance was with the powerful sects, its ties to the five clans were complicated — distant but necessary, official yet often transactional.
- Baek Clan The Empire saw the Baek mostly as coastal guardians and valuable trade partners. They relied on Baek ships for maritime safety and occasional patrols. The Baek were expected to report on sea traffic and maintain ports. The Empire tolerated their smuggling activities in exchange for loyalty and timely information.
- The Jang were tolerated as entertainers and distractions to the Empire, the Jang were mostly entertainers and hosts of grand banquets and celebrations. Though considered useless in warfare or politics, they were regular fixtures at imperial parties and festivals. The Empire paid the Jang a monthly stipend, expecting extravagant performances and lavish events in return — a welcome distraction for nobles.
- The Hwan clan were the only clan with a formal economic tie to the Empire. They handled part of the provincial trade tax and often hosted imperial officials, including the Minister of Revenue. Their sudden debt crisis was already a risk to the alliance. If they failed the upcoming inspection, not only would the Empire break ties — they might send soldiers. No other clan was watched more closely, or stood on thinner ice.
- The Yu clan held an important position through their control of key trading routes. The Empire depended on them to protect and maintain overland roads, which provided faster and more reliable passage for messages and supplies to the northern and western provinces. Their alliance was practical, rooted in commerce and strategic logistics rather than politics.
- Song clan relationship with the Empire grew through their control of the black market — a network unmatched for rare goods and secret information. While officially unacknowledged, the Empire saw Song as a useful, if dangerous, partner in intelligence and underground trade, with both sides careful to avoid direct conflict.

#### **6. Consequences**
The clans continued their struggles, balancing conflict with cooperation to maintain order. Their people were fed, villages kept safe, and life went on — not prosperous, but stable enough to survive. Though tensions simmered beneath the surface, none dared disrupt the fragile peace that held their provinces together.
Meanwhile, far beyond the clans’ lands, the Empire ruled flourished under the golden sun with a good political intrigue,and amazing alliance with the powerful sects. The alliance with the clans remained intact for now, but the 5 clans were waitinf for the yearly meeting which happens in the imperial city. The fate of both the Empire and the clans hung in a delicate balance, waiting for the next spark to ignite the coming storm.
