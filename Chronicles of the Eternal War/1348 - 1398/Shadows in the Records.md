**Chapter V: Shadows in the Records (Years 1364-1381)** Investigations begin as both sects and empire search for answers. Divine Seal Sect investigators uncover escalating demonic activity worldwide - desecrated shrines, vanishing caravans, silent districts, and brazen cultist recruitment. The Plum Blossom Sect seeks vengeance for their master while imperial records reveal the crisis's true scope. Demons are no longer hiding.

As investigations begin, disturbing reports flood in from across the empire. The Divine Seal Sect's network of investigators uncovers a pattern of escalating demonic activity. Village shrines are found desecrated with unrecognizable symbols carved deep into stone and blood smeared on them. Entire merchant caravans vanish on well-traveled roads, leaving behind only scorched earth and the smell of sulfur, animals are found desecrated and parts of them missing.
The Plum Blossom Sect, devastated by their master's death, requests the empires help in the investigation with fierce determination. Their disciples scour the burned mountain retreat, finding traces of inhuman footprints burned permanently into rock and metal weapons melted beyond recognition, the few that disciples of the divine seal sect that the empire sent notice traces of condensed corrupted qi like it was gathered over decades. 
Imperial records reveal the scope of the crisis. Tax collectors report entire districts going silent. Border garrisons send increasingly frantic messages about "creatures that laugh at steel and flame." Coastal watchtowers describe ships appearing on the horizon, only to vanish when approached, leaving behind only crimson stains on the water.
The demons are no longer hiding. Witnesses describe hooded figures openly walking through markets in broad daylight, their red eyes glowing beneath their hoods. Some even speak to locals, recruiting followers with promises of power beyond mortal understanding.



**Part One: The Divine Seal Investigation**
The Divine Seal Sect's network of investigators spreads across the empire like a web, following leads from the burned mountain retreat. What they uncover paints a picture of systematic corruption that has been festering for years. Village shrines throughout the outer provinces are found desecrated - ancient stones carved with symbols that hurt to look at directly, blood smeared in patterns that seem to move when observed peripherally.
Entire merchant caravans have vanished on well-traveled roads, leaving behind only scorched earth and the lingering stench of sulfur. The investigators find no bodies, no goods, no wagons - just blackened ground in perfect circles and the disturbing discovery that grass refuses to grow in these spots even months later.
Animals across multiple provinces are found mutilated in ritualistic patterns, with specific organs removed and arranged in geometric formations. The Divine Seal disciples recognize these as components for large-scale corruption rituals, far beyond anything a single cultist could perform.

**Part Two: The Plum Blossom Vendetta**

The Plum Blossom Sect, consumed by grief and rage over their master's death, throws their full resources into the investigation. Their disciples methodically scour every inch of the burned mountain retreat, documenting evidence with the precision of scholars and the fury of the bereaved.
They discover inhuman footprints burned permanently into solid rock, as if the creature that made them walked on molten metal. Weapons scattered throughout the battle site are melted beyond recognition - not from fire, but from something that ate through steel like acid. The few Divine Seal investigators sent by the empire identify traces of condensed corrupted qi so dense it had crystallized, suggesting decades of careful accumulation and preparation.
The Plum Blossom disciples compile detailed reports of their findings, demanding imperial support for a full-scale hunt for their master's killer. Their sect master, still maintaining his cold demeanor, personally oversees the investigation while planning a campaign of vengeance that will span provinces.

**Part Three: Imperial Records and Rising Terror**

Imperial records, when finally compiled and cross-referenced, reveal the true scope of the crisis. Tax collectors report entire districts going silent - not abandoned, but simply... empty. Houses remain furnished, meals left half-eaten on tables, but no trace of the inhabitants.
Border garrisons send increasingly frantic messages about "creatures that laugh at steel and flame" - beings that walk through arrow volleys without flinching and tear through armor with bare hands. Several outposts have gone completely silent, with relief forces finding only bloodstains and more of the strange symbols carved into fortress walls.
Coastal watchtowers describe phantom ships appearing on the horizon, sailing against the wind with no crew visible on deck. When patrol boats approach, the ships vanish, leaving behind only crimson stains spreading across the water like spilled wine.

**Part Four: The Demons Emerge**

The most disturbing reports come from the heart of the empire itself. Mysterious entities emerge from the shadow. Witnesses describe hooded figures walking openly through markets in broad daylight, their red eyes glowing beneath their hoods like burning coals. Citizens report feeling compelled to stare into those eyes, describing visions of power and transformation that leave them shaken for days.
Some of the hooded people have begun actively recruiting, approaching citizens with promises of power beyond mortal understanding. They speak of a coming age where the strong will rule and the weak will serve, where death is merely a transition to greater existence. A growing number of people, particularly those facing poverty or desperation, listen with increasing interest.

**Key Locations:**

**Key Characters:**

**Consequences:** The investigation reveals that the demon threat is far more extensive and organized than anyone imagined. What began as isolated incidents in the five clans' territories has spread across the entire empire. The demons have moved from hiding to open recruitment, suggesting they feel confident enough to reveal themselves. The stage is set for a much larger conflict, as both sects and empire realize they are facing not random cultists, but a coordinated demonic invasion that has been years in the making.
