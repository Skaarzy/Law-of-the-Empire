#### **5. Major Events / Plot Progression**

**Part I: The Golden Prosperity - Through the Player's Eyes** Upon arriving with their clan delegation, the player experiences the empire's most prosperous decade firsthand, witnessing trade networks and cultural achievements that dwarf anything in the clan territories.

- **Economic Boom**: The player marvels at merchant caravans bringing unprecedented wealth as silk, spices, and precious metals flow into the capital. Walking through markets that overflow with exotic goods, the player sees even common citizens enjoying prosperity that surpasses clan leaders back home. Well-dressed customers casually purchase items that would be luxuries in the territories, while children play safely in pristine neighborhoods - a stark contrast to the fear and uncertainty plaguing clan villages.
- **Cultural Renaissance**: The player witnesses the imperial court as a beacon of artistic achievement that puts clan entertainments to shame. Listening to poets compose verses celebrating the empire's glory, the player observes scholars debating philosophy in elegant tea houses with more books than entire clan libraries. The player sees the Emperor personally reviewing plans for new temples and bridges, treating cultural patronage as easily as clan leaders ration winter supplies.
- **Construction Projects**: The player watches in awe as massive building campaigns transform the capital before their eyes. New districts rise daily to accommodate growing populations, while the palace gardens bloom with rare flowers the player recognizes from the most remote corners of clan territories - now cultivated as mere decoration. Each completed project represents more wealth than most clan settlements see in years.
- **Court Ceremonies**: The player attends imperial palace ceremonies that sparkle with elaborate rituals beyond clan imagination. Observing noble families compete to host banquets featuring exotic delicacies, the player realizes a single course costs more than feeding an entire village. The player witnesses the Emperor's daily audiences, noting his absolute confidence in an authority that seems untouchable compared to the precarious leadership of clan elders.

**Part II: The Distant Concerns - What the Player Observes** While experiencing the empire's prosperity firsthand, the player begins to notice how reports from the outer provinces are routinely dismissed, creating a growing sense of unease about the disconnect between imperial perception and clan reality.

- **Provincial Reports**: The player overhears local magistrates presenting updates about successful harvests and rising populations to imperial officials, but notices how any mention of clan territories is quickly glossed over or dismissed. When the player attempts to share concerns about the mysterious occurrences back home, they're met with polite but condescending smiles and reassurances that "provincial matters" are being handled appropriately.
- **Tax Collection Success**: The player watches as revenue flows steadily into imperial coffers, funding ambitious projects, but realizes the tribute their own clan struggles to provide is treated as a minor line item in vast ledgers. The player observes Minister of Revenue Lee Hye-shin preparing for his annual inspection with bureaucratic confidence, clearly expecting routine compliance without understanding the desperate circumstances clans face.
- **Alliance Maintenance**: The player witnesses meetings between the Emperor and representatives of the powerful sects, noting how these spiritual leaders receive respect and attention that clan concerns never command. The player sees how the empire's most important allies are kept close while clan issues are relegated to brief administrative meetings.
- **Imperial Confidence**: The player experiences the young Emperor's absolute confidence firsthand during formal audiences, watching how he dismisses distant provincial concerns with casual waves of his hand. The player realizes that to the Emperor, clan territories exist mainly as sources of tribute and exotic goods rather than lands filled with struggling people facing mysterious threats.

**Part III: The Yearly Imperial Meeting** The empire's prosperity creates a bubble of ignorance around the imperial court, but the annual Imperial Meeting with the Five Clans provides a crucial opportunity for the player to witness both imperial splendor and the growing disconnect between the capital and the outer provinces.

- **The Imperial Summons**: Each clan leader receives the traditional golden scroll summoning them to the Imperial City for the yearly meeting. Along with the clan leaders, a select few representatives from each clan are chosen to accompany them - including the player character. This prestigious invitation allows the player to enter the heart of the empire and witness imperial politics firsthand.
- **Journey to the Capital**: The player travels with their clan delegation to the magnificent Imperial City, experiencing the stark contrast between the struggling clan territories and the empire's prosperous heart. The journey itself reveals the empire's impressive infrastructure and growing wealth.
- **The Imperial Assembly**: The formal meeting takes place in the grand Hall of Harmony, where the Emperor receives the five clan leaders to discuss territorial matters, implement new laws, and collect annual tributes. The player observes the elaborate ceremonies, court protocols, and the clear power dynamics between the empire and the clans.
- **Behind Closed Doors**: While the public ceremonies celebrate unity and prosperity, private discussions reveal the tension between imperial expectations and clan realities. The player witnesses how reports of mysterious occurrences are dismissed or downplayed by imperial officials more concerned with maintaining the illusion of perfect order.
- **New Imperial Decrees**: The Emperor announces new laws and policies that will affect the clan territories, often without understanding their practical implications for the struggling outer provinces. These decisions, made in ivory tower isolation, will have far-reaching consequences for the clans' ability to handle the growing supernatural threats.
- **The Growing Disconnect**: As the capital grows more prosperous and sophisticated, the distance between imperial concerns and clan realities becomes painfully obvious to the player. What seems like paradise in the cities contrasts sharply with the growing darkness in the outer territories, but this contrast remains invisible to those in power.

#### **6. Consequences**

The empire's golden age reaches its peak, creating unprecedented prosperity and cultural achievement. Citizens in major cities enjoy safety, comfort, and opportunity, while the imperial court celebrates its remarkable success. Construction projects reshape the landscape, trade networks expand imperial influence, and artistic achievements mark this as a legendary period in the empire's history.

However, this very success breeds dangerous complacency. The imperial court's focus on ceremonial splendor and cultural patronage creates a blind spot regarding distant provincial concerns. Reports from the five clan territories are routinely dismissed or ignored, allowing mysterious and potentially dangerous developments to grow unchecked in the shadows of the empire's brilliance.

The widening gap between imperial prosperity and clan struggles sets the stage for future crisis. While the Emperor basks in his reign's achievements, confident that his empire has achieved lasting stability, the seeds of chaos continue to sprout in the forgotten corners of his realm, invisible to those who believe their golden age will last forever.
