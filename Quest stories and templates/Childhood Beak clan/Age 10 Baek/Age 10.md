## **Two Years Later - Age 10: Solo Rebellion]**

_The afternoon sun filters through the paper windows of your small room, casting long shadows across the worn wooden floor. Ancient texts and scrolls are scattered across your low desk‚Äîyour daily burden of study._

**Mentor (voice stern and commanding from the doorway):**  
"Brat! Get yourself to your room and start studying that clan history book I gave you. Every page, every character, every story. I don't want to see your face until you can recite the lineage of the first five clan heads without stumbling."

**MC (shoulders slumping as he trudges toward his room):**  
"Yes, Master... more dusty old stories about dead people."

**Mentor (calling after him):**  
"Those 'dead people' are your ancestors, you ungrateful whelp! Their blood runs in your veins. Show some respect, or I'll make you copy the entire book by hand!"

_[Time passes - represented by a montage of the MC reading, yawning, his head nodding as boredom sets in]_

### üìö **[Several Hours Later - MC's Room]**

_The clan history book lies open before you, filled with elaborate family trees and ancient deeds. Your eyelids grow heavy as you struggle through another passage about territorial disputes from centuries past._

**MC (rubbing his eyes, talking to himself):**  
"Ugh... this is torture. 'In the third year of the Azure Dragon Dynasty, Clan Head Minho successfully negotiated...' Who cares?! This happened before grandfather's grandfather was even born!"

_You glance toward the window, then back at the book. An idea begins to form._

**MC (suddenly perking up):**  
"Wait... Father would know these stories way better than this dusty old book. He lived through some stuff! And the old man's probably taking his afternoon nap by now..."

_You look toward your window, then at the door, weighing your options._

**MC (grinning mischievously):**  
"What he doesn't know won't hurt him, right? I'll just ask Father a few questions and be back before the geezer wakes up."

### ü™ü **[The Great Escape Begins]**

_Moving as quietly as possible, you slide open your window. The afternoon breeze carries the scent of the harbor and the sound of distant training from the main house grounds._

**MC (whispering to himself as he climbs onto the windowsill):**  
"Just a quick visit to Father... then right back to studying. Easy."

_You carefully lower yourself onto the sloped roof tiles below your window. The clay tiles are warm from the sun but treacherously smooth._

**[GAMEPLAY MOMENT: Player must carefully navigate across the roof tiles]**

_Suddenly, your foot slips! You scramble for grip, sending several tiles clattering down to shatter in the courtyard below._

**CRASH! CLATTER! SMASH!**

**Mentor (voice booming from inside the house, clearly startled from his nap):**  
"WHAT IN THE SEVEN HELLS WAS THAT?! IF THOSE DAMN DRUNKARDS FROM THE TAVERN ARE AT IT AGAIN, I'LL BEAT THE ALCOHOL OUT OF THEM WITH MY BARE HANDS!"

_Heavy footsteps thunder across the floor inside. You freeze in terror on the roof._

**MC (heart pounding, whispering frantically):**  
"Oh no, oh no, oh no... he's going to skin me alive if he catches me!"

**Mentor (voice getting closer to the window):**  
"I swear by my ancestors, if someone's trying to break into my house in broad daylight..."

---

### üèÉ **[STEALTH GAMEPLAY BEGINS]**

**[PLAYER OBJECTIVE: Avoid being seen by the Mentor while escaping]**

_You must carefully move across the roof, timing your movements to avoid the Mentor's line of sight as he searches from various windows. Use the shadows cast by the roof's architecture and the rhythm of his patrol pattern._

**Mentor (muttering as he searches different windows):**  
"Probably just those mangy cats again... or maybe the wind... but those tiles didn't break themselves..."

_[Once the player successfully evades detection, they can proceed to the next area]_

---

### üß± **[Over the Garden Wall]**

_Having successfully avoided your mentor's detection, you slide down the back of the roof and drop silently into the garden. The traditional compound wall looms before you‚Äîtall stone topped with curved tiles, designed to keep the world out and the family in._

**MC (looking up at the wall, then around for options):**  
"Alright, now I just need to get over this wall without breaking my neck... or alerting the entire neighborhood."

_You spot a section where the ancient stones have shifted slightly, creating small handholds. Taking a deep breath, you begin to climb._

**[GAMEPLAY MOMENT: Climbing sequence - player must find the right handholds and maintain stamina]**

_Reaching the top, you carefully slide over the curved tiles and drop down on the outside. Freedom! But now you're faced with a choice._

**MC (looking around, getting his bearings):**  
"Okay, Father should be at the main house on the mountain... but how do I get there without being seen?"

---

### üõ§Ô∏è **[THE GREAT DECISION]**

_Before you lie two distinct paths to reach your father at the mountain-top main house:_

**üèîÔ∏è [[PATH 1 MOUNTAIN CLIMB]]**  
_A steep, rocky path winds up the mountainside. It's more direct but challenging, requiring careful navigation of cliffs and hidden trails. Fewer people, but more physical danger._

üèòÔ∏è [[PATH 2 THROUGH THE STREETS]]  
_The winding village streets offer cover among market stalls and buildings, but you'll need to avoid curious neighbors, busy merchants, and anyone who might recognize you and report back to your mentor._

[[PATH 3 TRAINING GROUNDS]]  
_The training grounds are practically across the street, making it the shortest route. However, the area is restricted to clan warriors only, and tonight drunk naval fighters are holding a steel-weapon competition._

**MC (hands on hips, studying both options):**  
"Hmm... the mountain's dangerous, but at least I won't run into drunkards or dangerous people . On the other hand, the streets have places to hide if things go wrong and the part where i cant fall to my death..."

**[PLAYER CHOICE POINT: Select your path to the main house]**

_Your adventure continues based on the path you choose..._
