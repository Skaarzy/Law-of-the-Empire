MC (dusting off his hands after the wall climb):
"The training grounds it is. I've always wondered what real combat looks like, not just the practice forms Master makes me do alone."

You begin making your way through the familiar streets, but this journey is much shorter than expected. The training grounds are practically across the street from your compound—so close you can already hear the sounds of combat and celebration.

MC (surprised at how close it is):
"I had no idea it was this close! I can already hear them fighting!"

As you approach, the sounds grow louder—steel clashing against steel, men shouting, and the unmistakable roar of warriors celebrating.

MC (getting excited):
"This is perfect! Finally, I can see real warriors in action!"

The Entrance Problem
You reach the training grounds and immediately see the problem. A circular stone wall surrounds the area, and at the main entrance, guards are checking everyone who tries to enter.

Guard (stopping a villager):
"Sorry, friend. Training grounds are for clan warriors only tonight. No spectators allowed."
Disappointed Villager:
"But we just wanted to watch the competition!"

Guard:
"Orders are orders. Warriors only."

MC (hiding behind a cart, frustrated):
"Of course there are guards. And of course they're not letting anyone in to watch."
You were planning to just sneak in with the crowd, but that plan is ruined. Looking around, you spot a house right next to the training grounds.

MC (getting an idea):
"If I can't get in through the front, maybe I can see from above!"

The Roof Climb
You circle around to the house adjacent to the training grounds. Behind it, you find exactly what you need—stacked supply boxes and crates leading up to the lower section of the roof.

MC (starting to climb):
"Just like climbing the wall at home, except higher..."

Box by box, you make your way up. The wooden crates creak under your weight, but they hold. Soon you're on the lower roof section, then climbing toward the peak.
Finally, you reach the top and can see over the training ground walls. What you see takes your breath away.

The Arena
Inside the circular stone walls is a medium-sized round sand pit with wooden logs arranged in a circle marking the boundaries of the fighting ring. But what captures your attention are the warriors themselves.

Shirtless men wearing only loose pants are engaged in brutal combat with real steel weapons—swords, spears, and axes gleaming in the torchlight. Their bodies glisten with sweat and bear the scars of countless battles.

MC (eyes wide with amazement):
"They're using real weapons! And they're all so... powerful!"

The warriors move with deadly grace, their strikes precise and powerful. Blood flows from minor cuts, but they fight on with grins on their faces.

Warrior 1 (laughing as he parries a strike):
"Come on, you can hit harder than that!"

Warrior 2 (pressing his attack):
"I'm just getting warmed up!"

MC (leaning forward eagerly):
"This is incredible! But I need to see them closer..."

The Back Entrance
Looking around from your elevated position, you spot something useful—a small exit at the back of the training area, leading to what appears to be the public toilets.

MC (climbing down from the roof):
"Perfect! A back way in!"

You carefully make your way down and around to the rear of the training grounds. The back entrance is less guarded, with only a few drunk warriors stumbling in and out.
Timing your movement perfectly, you slip past a warrior who's clearly had too much to drink and is more focused on not falling over than watching for intruders.

Inside the Arena
You're in! The training grounds are even more impressive from inside. The sand pit is surrounded by warriors cheering, drinking, and waiting their turn to fight. The clash of steel is deafening, and the energy is intoxicating.

MC (finding a spot behind some equipment, watching in awe):
"This is amazing! Look at those moves!"

You watch, transfixed, as warriors demonstrate techniques you've only read about in books. Their spear work is fluid and deadly, their footwork perfect despite their celebration.

You're so absorbed in the fighting that you don't notice the massive shadow falling over you until...

CLAMP!

A hand like stone grabs your shoulder. Your heart stops as you slowly turn around.

The Confrontation
Behind you stands a massive hooded figure, easily the largest man you've ever seen. His grip on your shoulder is firm but not painful.

Hooded Figure (voice stern and deep):
"What are you doing here, son? Is this what you do at night? Sneak around and visit places you aren't allowed into?"

MC (terrified, voice barely a whisper):
"I... I just wanted to see... I'm sorry, I'll leave right now, I promise—"

The figure reaches up and pulls back his hood, revealing...

Father (sighing deeply):
"Of all the places you could have chosen to explore..."

MC (thinking he's about to die):
"Father! I... I can explain! I was just curious about real combat, and I thought maybe—"

Father (disappointed, shaking his head):
"Curious about combat? So you decided to sneak into a warrior competition? Do you have any idea how dangerous this is? These men are using real steel!"

MC (words tumbling out desperately):
"I know, I know it was dangerous, but Father, the book Master gave me to study was so boring! It just talks about battles and techniques, but it doesn't show what they actually look like! I wanted to see real warriors, real fighting, not just words on a page!"

Father (his disappointment deepening):
"So because a book was boring, you decided to risk your life? You climbed buildings, snuck past guards, and entered a restricted area where grown warriors are fighting with lethal weapons?"

MC (desperately trying to make him understand):
"The book made everything sound so dry and lifeless! But I knew if I could see real combat, real techniques, then maybe I'd understand what our ancestors actually did! I wanted to learn, Father, I really did!"

Father (staring at him for a long moment, then sighing heavily):
"Your thirst for knowledge reminds me of myself at your age... but your methods are absolutely reckless."

Father (holding up his hand, then sighing again):
"Well, now that you're here... let me explain some of the moves they're using. These warriors follow strict rules—no dirty fighting, no fatal wounds. It's about skill and honor."
