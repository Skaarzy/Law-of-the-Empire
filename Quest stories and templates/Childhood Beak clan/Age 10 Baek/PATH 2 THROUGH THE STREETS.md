MC (dusting off his hands after the wall climb):
"The forge it is. I've always wondered how they make those amazing weapons Father talks about. Maybe I can see the smiths at work!"

You begin making your way through the familiar harbor streets, but something feels different. The first few meters are eerily quiet—not a single soul in sight.

MC (looking around nervously):
"Where is everyone? It's like the whole town just... vanished."

But as you move closer to the heart of the harbor district, the reason becomes clear. Distant sounds of celebration grow louder with each step—singing, cheering, and the unmistakable sound of many people having a very good time.

MC (eyes widening with realization):
"Oh no... they're celebrating Father's expedition! The whole town must be out there..."

As you round the corner into the main street, your heart sinks. What was once a quiet path is now bustling with activity. Red lanterns have been strung up even in daylight, and people are everywhere—singing, drinking, and celebrating the successful fishing expedition your father led.

Random Townsperson (shouting over the noise):
"Three times the normal catch! The clan head's luck never fails us!"

Another Voice:
"The sea spirits must truly favor our lord! Such a blessing!"

The celebration makes sneaking infinitely more difficult. You'll need to crouch behind carts, crawl under stalls, and time your movements carefully to avoid the many drunk and merry townspeople.

The Fish Cart Gambit
As you duck behind a wooden cart, trying to catch your breath, you notice an opportunity. An elderly man is slowly dragging a covered cart along the street, and he's clearly had more than his share of celebratory drinks.

MC (whispering to himself):
"Perfect! I can hide under that blanket and ride right through the crowd!"

You time your movement perfectly, slipping under the rough blanket just as the old man continues his unsteady journey. But immediately, you're hit by the most horrific smell imaginable.

MC (fighting back nausea, internal monologue):
"Oh gods... this cart is full of fish! Raw, stinking, rotting fish! Don't throw up, don't throw up, don't throw up..."

The cart lurches and sways as the drunk old man stumbles along. You can hear him muttering incoherently.

Drunk Old Man (slurring badly):
"Stupid... stupid fish... why'd I volunteer... should've stayed at the tavern..."

Suddenly, the cart stops moving. There's a loud THUD and a splash, followed by creative cursing.

Drunk Old Man (from the muddy street):
"Blast and damnation! Curse this mud! Curse these fish! Curse my aching bones!"

You peek out from under the blanket to see the old man face-first in a puddle, too drunk to get up quickly. This is your chance!

MC (scrambling out of the cart):
"Freedom! Sweet, non-fishy freedom!"

Tavern Gossip
As you continue through the streets, staying low and moving from shadow to shadow, you pass by The Weathered Anchor tavern. Through the open windows, you can hear familiar voices.

Townsperson 1:
"Did you see the size of those tuna? The clan head's got the sea's own blessing, I tell you!"

Townsperson 2:
"Aye, and did you hear? Even after bringing in such a catch, he's already planning the next expedition. No rest for that one!"

But as you move closer to the tavern, you hear another conversation that makes you stop and listen.

Grizzled Old Fisherman:
"Ha! You know what I heard? That old mentor of the clan heir... they say he's nothing but a grumpy old fart who barks orders all day."

His Drinking Companion:
"Grumpy? That's putting it mildly! But you know what's funny? I've seen him with the boy. Soft as fresh bread when it comes to that kid. All that gruffness melts away like snow in spring!"

MC (covering his mouth to stifle laughter):
"Ha! If only they knew how 'soft' he was this morning when he made me read books for hours!"

Approaching the Forge
Successfully navigating through the celebration, you finally reach the clan forge. The building glows with heat from the furnaces, and you can hear the rhythmic hammering of metal on metal.

MC (approaching cautiously):
"Perfect! I can finally see how they make our clan's famous weapons!"

But as you peer around the corner, your heart sinks. The forge is bustling with activity - smiths, apprentices, and several clan members are gathered around the main workspace. And there, directing the work...

Father (instructing the smiths):
"The harpoon points need to be sharper for the next expedition. And ensure the rope attachments are reinforced."

MC (hiding behind a supply cart):
"Father's here too! How am I supposed to get close enough to see the weapon-making with all these people around?"

You wait patiently, watching the fascinating process of weapon creation from your hiding spot. Sparks fly as hammers strike red-hot metal, and you can see the smiths carefully shaping spear points and harpoon heads. But there are too many eyes for you to get closer.

Just when you're about to give up...

Father (to the smiths):
"Continue with the spear repairs. I need to inspect the new armor pieces in the back courtyard."

Your father heads toward the rear of the forge, and this is your chance!

The Back Courtyard - The Confrontation
You slip through the forge's back entrance into a small courtyard where newly forged weapons and armor pieces are cooling on wooden racks. Your father stands examining a set of plate armor, running his hands over the metal to check for imperfections.

The moment you step into the courtyard...
SHING!

Cold steel touches your neck. Your father's eyes are fierce and angry as he holds his blade steady.

Father (voice deadly serious):
"Explain yourself, intruder, before I—"

His expression changes instantly when he recognizes you.

Father (lowering his sword, anger replaced by concern and frustration):
"What in the name of our ancestors are you doing here?! Do you have any idea how dangerous—"

MC (words tumbling out quickly):
"Father, please! I was studying like Master told me to, but I kept reading about our clan's legendary weapons and I wanted to see how they're actually made, and I climbed out the window and came through the streets and—"

Father (holding up his hand, his anger slowly giving way to understanding):
"Stop. Breathe. Start from the beginning."

After you explain the full story—your mentor's assignment, your escape, your journey through the celebrating town, your fascination with the weapon-making process—your father's expression softens slightly.

Father (sighing deeply, but with a slight smile):
"Your curiosity about our clan's traditions reminds me of myself at your age. But that doesn't make this acceptable."

He picks up a beautifully crafted harpoon from the cooling rack.

Father:
"Since you risked so much to see our weapons... let me show you the craftsmanship of our ancestors and explain why each design choice matters in battle."

He tells you about the forging techniques, the balance of the weapons, and the stories behind each design, making the cold metal feel alive with history and purpose.

Father (as he finishes the explanation):
"Now, I'll escort you to the forge entrance. After that, take the main road home—no more climbing and sneaking. And when you see your mentor... well, you'll face whatever consequences come."

The Journey Home
Your father walks you to the forge entrance, where he gives you a final stern but loving look.

Father:
"Remember what I told you about our family's weapons and their purposes. But also remember—knowledge comes not just from curiosity, but from knowing when and how to seek it properly."

The walk home along the main road gives you time to think about everything that's happened. As you approach your mentor's house, dread begins to build in your stomach.

MC (hesitating at the garden gate):
"Maybe... maybe he's still napping? If I can just get back to my room without him noticing..."

You spot the ladder in the garden—the same one used for maintaining the roof tiles. Perfect for a quiet return to your window.

The Final Climb
You carefully position the ladder against the wall below your window. Each rung creaks slightly, but you move slowly and deliberately.

MC (whispering to himself):
"Almost there... just need to get through the window and back to the book..."
You slide open your window and slip inside, thinking you've made it safely. But as you turn around...

Mentor (arms crossed, face thunderous with rage):
"HOW?! WHEN?! WHY?!"

He's sitting in your chair, your clan history book open on the desk, clearly having discovered your absence.

MC (heart sinking):
"Master, I can explain—"

Mentor (voice rising with each word):
"EXPLAIN?! You climbed out a window! Snuck through the entire town! And you want to EXPLAIN?!"

You tell him everything—your curiosity about the weapons mentioned in the book, your escape, your adventure through the celebrating streets, your conversation with your father at the forge. As you speak, you watch your mentor's expression cycle through anger, disbelief, reluctant admiration, and finally resignation.

Mentor (after a long pause, rubbing his temples):
"That... that's exactly something your father would have done at your age. And your grandfather before him. Seven hells, it's like watching history repeat itself..."

He lets out a long, defeated sigh.

Mentor (pointing sternly at the book):
"Fine. You want to understand our weapons? You want to see how everything connects? Here's your consequence: You BETTER know that ENTIRE book by morning—word for word, page for page, every single character and story. Because if you don't, you won't see the outside of these house walls until you reach adulthood!"

MC (nodding frantically):
"Yes, Master! I'll study all night if I have to!"

Mentor (muttering as he heads for the door):
"Stubborn, reckless, too clever for his own good... just like his bloodline. At least he got a proper lesson about our clan's craftsmanship..."

As the door closes behind him, you settle down with the clan history book, but now the words seem more alive, more meaningful after your father's explanations and your own adventure.

MC (opening the book with renewed interest):
"Well... at least now I know why these weapons and stories matter."
