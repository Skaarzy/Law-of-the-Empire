## **PATH 1: THE MOUNTAIN CLIMB]**

MC (looking up at the daunting climb ahead):
"Well, the pavilion it is. If I can see Father's maps and planning, maybe I'll understand how all these historical strategies actually work in practice."

You choose the steep mountain path, deciding that physical danger is preferable to social complications. The rocky trail winds upward, disappearing into mist and shadow.

MC (looking up at the daunting climb ahead):
"Father always said I was part mountain goat anyway..."

### ‚õ∞Ô∏è **[The Ascent Begins]**

**[STAMINA SYSTEM ACTIVATED: Limited climbing energy - must manage carefully]**

_The first section of cliff face looms before you. Rough granite provides decent handholds, but the height is intimidating._

**[GAMEPLAY: Climbing Sequence 1]**

- _Player must navigate upward using stamina_
- _Each move costs stamina_
- _Poor choices drain more energy_

_Your arms burn as you pull yourself up, muscles already protesting the unfamiliar strain._

**[FIRST STANDING PLATFORM REACHED]**

_A narrow ledge, barely wide enough for both feet, provides blessed relief. Small birds nest in crevices around you, chirping curiously at this unexpected visitor._

**MC (breathing heavily, wiping sweat):**  
"Okay... that wasn't so bad. Just need to catch my breath and..."

_A small sparrow lands near your hand, tilting its head as if asking what you're doing so far from home._

**[STAMINA REGENERATION: Rest period on platform]**

---

### ü™® **[Second Ascent]**

_Feeling refreshed, you tackle the next section. This climb is steeper, requiring more careful foot placement._

**[GAMEPLAY: Climbing Sequence 2]**

_Halfway up, you reach another narrow platform where a family of ravens has built their nest. They caw disapprovingly at your intrusion._

**MC (apologetically to the ravens):**  
"Sorry, sorry! Just passing through!"

**[STAMINA REGENERATION: Rest period on platform]**

---

### ü™® **[Third Ascent - The Larger Platform]**

_This climb leads to a more substantial ledge - wide enough to walk around and catch your breath properly. The view of the harbor below is breathtaking._

**MC (admiring the vista):**  
"Wow... I can see the whole harbor from here. No wonder Father chose this place."

_Several bird nests dot the rocky outcroppings, and you can hear the distant sound of training from somewhere above._

**[FULL STAMINA REGENERATION: Major rest point]**

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **[Fourth Ascent - DISASTER STRIKES]**

_Feeling confident, you begin the next climb. But this section of mountain is older, more weathered..._

**[GAMEPLAY: Climbing Sequence 4 - with hazard]**

_You're almost to the next platform when..._

**CRACK!**

_The rock you're gripping crumbles away! Your heart stops as you plummet backward, arms windmilling desperately._

**MC (screaming):**  
"NOOOO‚Äî!"

_THUD! You crash onto the larger platform below, the wind knocked from your lungs._

**MC (groaning, checking for injuries):**  
"Ow... ow... okay, nothing broken. But that route's definitely out."

_Looking around the platform, you notice it extends further along the mountain face than you initially realized._

**[EXPLORATION GAMEPLAY: Navigate the narrow platform edge]**

_Walking carefully along the ledge, arms pressed against the rock face for balance, you discover the platform connects to a different section of the mountain._

**MC (relieved):**  
"There! A whole new route. Thanks for the detour, stupid crumbly rock."

---

### üßó **[Alternative Route - Fifth Ascent]**

_This new section looks more promising - the rock is solid granite, and the handholds are deeper._

**[GAMEPLAY: Climbing Sequence 5]**

_You reach another narrow platform where a hawk eyes you suspiciously from its nest._

**[STAMINA REGENERATION: Rest period]**

---

### üèîÔ∏è **[Final Ascent - Sixth Climb]**

_One last push to the summit. Your arms shake with exhaustion, but determination drives you upward._

**[GAMEPLAY: Final Climbing Sequence]**

_With a final grunt of effort, you haul yourself over the edge and collapse on solid ground._

**MC (panting heavily):**  
"Made it... finally made it..."

---

### üèÆ **[The Pavilion Compound]**

_Before you stretches an elegant pavilion complex, traditional architecture nestled into the mountain top. But between you and your goal stands a smooth stone wall._

_From the front entrance comes the sound of celebration - guards laughing, drinking, and making merry._

**Guard voices (from around the front):**  
"Ha! Another successful fishing expedition!"  
"The boats came back loaded to the brim!"  
"Master's strategies never fail!"

**MC (frustrated, examining the wall):**  
"Perfect. Of course there's a wall. And of course it's completely smooth with no handholds whatsoever."

_You circle around, staying in the shadows, until you spot something promising..._

---

### üì¶ **[The Supply Cart Solution]**

_Against a section of the back wall, someone has left a cart loaded with supply boxes - food, tools, and materials for the compound._

**MC (eyes lighting up):**  
"There's my ladder!"

**[GAMEPLAY: Careful climbing sequence on unstable cart]**

_You climb carefully onto the cart, then onto the boxes. They wobble precariously under your weight..._

_Almost at the wall top, you reach for the final handhold when..._

**CRASH! CLATTER! THUNK!**

_Several boxes tumble from the cart, their contents spilling across the ground._

**MC (freezing in terror, clinging to the wall):**  
"Oh no... they definitely heard that..."

_But the celebration at the front entrance continues unabated, the guards too drunk and merry to notice distant crashes._

**Guard voices (still celebrating):**  
"Another round! Another round!"  
"To the Master's wisdom!"

**MC (relieved whisper):**  
"Thank the ancestors for loud drunks..."

---

### üèÉ **[Wall Walking Challenge]**

_Now you're on top of the wall, but getting down is another problem entirely. The inner courtyard is too far to jump safely._

**[GAMEPLAY: Balance walking along narrow wall top]**

_You carefully walk along the wall's edge, arms outstretched for balance, searching for a way down._

_Finally, you spot salvation - a storage shed built against the inner wall._

**MC (quietly celebrating):**  
"Perfect! My own personal staircase."

_You lower yourself onto the shed roof, then prepare for the final jump._

**[GAMEPLAY: Jumping sequence with injury consequence]**

_The jump to the ground is further than expected..._

**THUD!**

_You hit the courtyard stones hard, pain shooting through your knees and arms._

**MC (wincing but determined, brushing dirt off scraped arms):**  
"Ow... that's going to bruise tomorrow. But I'm here. That's what matters."

---

### üèõÔ∏è **[Infiltrating the Pavilion]**

_The main pavilion glows with warm lamplight. You can hear the guards' continued celebration masking your approach._

**Guard voices (still at front entrance):**  
"Master's so disciplined... instead of celebrating our successful fishing trip, he's already planning the next expedition!"  
"That's why we never fail under his leadership!"  
"A toast to preparation!"

**MC (understanding):**  
"So Father's alone in there, working while everyone else celebrates... typical."

**[PLAYER CHOICE: Enter through door or window]**

_Moving like a shadow, you slip toward the main building..._

---

### ‚öîÔ∏è **[Face to Face with Father]**

_You quietly enter the main room where your father sits alone, scrolls and maps spread before him by lamplight._

_The moment you step inside..._

**SHING!**

_Cold steel appears at your throat faster than you can blink._

**Father (eyes blazing with fury, sword steady):**  
"Who dares‚Äî"

_Recognition dawns. The sword lowers, but his expression grows even more thunderous._

**Father (voice deadly quiet):**  
"What... in the name of all my ancestors... are you doing here? How did you‚Äî? Do you have any idea how dangerous‚Äî?"

**MC (swallowing hard but standing straight):**  
"Father, I can explain! I was studying the clan history like Master ordered, but the book was so boring and confusing, and I thought maybe you could tell me the stories better because you actually lived through some of‚Äî"

Father (confused):
"Stop. Just... stop." He sheathes his sword and rubs his temples. "You came alone at age ten to ask me about historical strategies and planning."

MC (nodding earnestly):
"The book talks about all these amazing victories and expeditions, but I wanted to see how you actually plan them! The maps, the charts, the way you think through everything!"

Father (cutting him off with a raised hand):
"You climbed the mountain on your own at the age of 10. Do you even know how dangerous..." He stops himself

Father stares at him for a long moment, anger warring with something that might be pride.

Father (sighing deeply):
"Your mentor is going to have both our heads for this. But... fine. ONE explanation about planning and strategy. That's all. Then you go straight home, and we never speak of this foolish adventure again."

Father's stern expression softens slightly as he gestures for you to sit.

Father:
"Since you risked life and limb to understand it... let me show you how we plan these expeditions and why every detail in those history books mattered to our ancestors' survival..."

Father:
"Remember what I told you about planning and strategy. But also remember‚Äîwisdom comes not just from knowledge, but from knowing when and how to seek it properly."

### üåô **[The Return Journey]**

_After the story, your father escorts you to a back entrance of the compound._

**Father (still stern but concerned):**  
"You can use the normal path down - it's getting dark and I won't have you breaking your neck on my watch. But boy..."

**MC (looking up attentively):**  
"Yes, Father?"

**Father:**  
"Next time you want to hear family stories, just ask your mentor to bring you here properly. That old man loves those tales more than anyone."

_The walk down is much easier via the proper mountain path. Soon you're back at your compound, looking up at your bedroom window._

**MC (spotting garden ladders conveniently placed against the wall):**  
"Well, at least getting back to my room should be easier than getting out was..."

**[GAMEPLAY: Climbing sequence using ladders and roof access]**

_You climb the ladder, cross the familiar roof tiles, and slip through your bedroom window with practiced ease._

_Victory! You're back in your room, and no one's the wiser. You even have time to arrange the history book to look like you've been studying all along._

_You're just settling back at your desk when..._

**Mentor (voice like thunder from directly behind you):**  
"Well, well, well..."

_You freeze. Slowly, you turn around._

_Your mentor stands in the doorway, arms crossed, eyes blazing with fury._

**Mentor (voice rising to a roar):**  
"ARE YOU COMPLETELY MAD?! HOW COULD YOU‚Äî?! WHY DID YOU‚Äî?! THE CLIMBING, THE SNEAKING, THE RISKING YOUR WORTHLESS NECK!"

**MC (shrinking back but trying to explain):**  
You tell him everything‚Äîyour confusion about the strategic planning mentioned in the book, your escape, your adventure through the mountain climb, your conversation with your father about expedition planning. As you speak, you watch your mentor's expression cycle through anger, disbelief, reluctant admiration, and finally resignation.

Mentor (muttering as he heads for the door):
"Stubborn, reckless, too clever for his own good... just like his bloodline. At least he got a proper lesson about strategic thinking..."

As the door closes behind him, you settle down with the clan history book, but now the words seem more alive, more meaningful after your father's strategic explanations and your own adventure.

MC (opening the book with renewed interest):
"Well... at least now I know how all these plans and strategies actually work."
