_They make their way through the pre-dawn streets toward the harbor._

**MC:**  
"Thank you, Master! I promise I'll make you proud today!"

**Mentor (muttering under his breath):**  
"Proud... at this hour... ungrateful brat..."

_At the harbor, the scene is bustling with activity. Older fishermen families are saying tearful goodbyes to their beloved ones, while others load cargo - food, supplies, and equipment onto various boats. The journey will last about two weeks._

**Mentor (looking up at the sky with exasperation):**  
"Why are you doing this to me? Is this payback for my previous life? Did I do something horrible to be treated like thisâ€”"

**MC's Father (arriving with a group of what appear to be big, drunk sailors, though he himself remains composed):**  
"I see you arrived early, son."

**Mentor (cutting him off angrily):**  
"THIS DAMN BRAT WAKES ME UP IN THE HOUR OF THE TIGER JUST SO HE CAN ARRIVE BEFORE YOU! WHY IS THE BAEK FAMILY SO STUBBORN?!"

**MC's Father (laughing and ignoring the mentor's rambling):**  
"Well, enthusiasm is a good trait for a warrior. Come, let's board."

_As they enter the boat, the mentor shows MC around, giving him a complete tour of the ship inside and out._

**Mentor:**  
"This is the main deck, that's the crow's nest, those are the fishing nets, this is where we store the catch..."

**MC (looking around in wonder):**  
"It's bigger than I thought it would be!"

**Mentor:**  
"Of course it is, brat. This isn't some little fishing boat - this is a proper expedition vessel."

_After a couple of days at sea, a lookout shouts from above._

**Lookout:**  
"Ship approaching! Black sails! Black flag!"

**MC's Father (immediately taking command, voice booming across the deck):**  
"Everyone who isn't a warrior - back into the cabins! Warriors, be ready! Pirates are approaching!"

**Mentor (turning to MC seriously):**  
"You stay here, brat, and experience your first real fight. This is the reason you came along, right?"

**MC (nodding excitedly):**  
"Yes! I'm ready!"

**Mentor (slapping MC's head):**  
"Calm down! Compose yourself and be ready!"

_As the mentor starts heading toward the cabins, MC calls out._

**MC:**  
"Aren't you going to fight as well, Master?"

**Mentor (yelling back):**  
"YOU WANT THIS OLD MAN TO FIGHT PIRATES?! MY BONES MIGHT BREAK JUST FROM SWINGING MY SWORD!"

**MC (groaning and mumbling):**  
"Stop pretending you're weak, Mentor..."

**Mentor (yelling back angrily):**  
"I HEARD YOU, YOU BRAT! I'M GOING INSIDE JUST IN CASE SOME PIRATES TRY TO SNEAK IN! HMPH! I AM NO COWARD! HOW DARE YOU THINK THAT!"

_The pirate ship pulls alongside, and armed pirates begin boarding. The fighting begins as MC must defeat the pirates while making sure none of the crew die, using everything he's been taught._

## **Aggressive Build Path (Twin Harpoons)**

_After the battle, MC's father approaches, wiping blood from his sword._

**MC's Father:**  
"Impressive, son. Your speed and precision with those harpoons reminded me of the old naval stories. You struck fast and kept moving - exactly what aggressive fighters should do."

**MC (breathing hard but grinning):**  
"Did I really do well, Father?"

**MC's Father:**  
"You did. But remember - in real combat, hesitation kills. I saw you pause a few times. Trust your instincts more, and don't overthink your attacks."

_As they head back, the mentor emerges from the cabins._

**Mentor (looking MC up and down critically):**  
"Well, well. Look at our little warrior. You were slow on your third opponent, and that spinning move you tried was so clumsy I thought you were going to tie yourself up with your own ropes."

**MC:**  
"But I won, didn't I?"

**Mentor:**  
"Barely. And if those pirates had been anything more than drunk fools, you'd be fish food right now, brat."

_As they return to port, MC's father approaches his son._

**MC's Father (patting MC's head with a warm smile):**  
"Good job today, son. You've proven yourself worthy of real missions."

**MC (pulling away, embarrassed):**  
"Daaad! I'm not a child anymore!"

**Mentor (chuckling at the sight):**  
"Seeing how red you are, most would say you are one."

**MC (getting more embarrassed and flustered):**  
"At least I'm not a grumpy old man!"

**Mentor (yelling angrily):**  
"WHAT DID YOU SAY, YOU BRAT?!"

**MC (already running toward home):**  
"Nothing! Nothing! See you at training tomorrow!"

**Mentor (chasing after him, still yelling):**  
"GET BACK HERE! I'LL SHOW YOU WHO'S OLD!"
