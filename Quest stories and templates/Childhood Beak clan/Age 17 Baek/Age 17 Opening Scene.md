**MC (shaking his mentor awake in the pre-dawn darkness):**  
"Master! Master, wake up! We need to get ready! Today's the day!"

**Mentor (groggily, eyes still closed):**  
"Mmph... what... what time is it...? I swear this brat will be the end of me..."

**MC (practically vibrating with excitement):**  
"It's the hour of the tiger! Come on, get up! I don't want to be late for my first ever fishing expedition with Father!"

**Mentor (sitting up slowly, rubbing his eyes and looking furious):**  
"YOU BRAT! THE BOAT DEPARTS AT THE HOUR OF THE RABBIT! You could have let me sleep a little longer!"

**MC (making a sad, pleading face):**  
"But I don't want to miss it, Mentor..."

**Mentor (groaning and getting to his feet):**  
"Fine! Fine! Then let's go wait in the stinking harbor for your father... whom I will kill when I see him..."

_They make their way through the pre-dawn streets toward the harbor._

**MC:**  
"Thank you, Master! I promise I'll make you proud today!"

**Mentor (muttering under his breath):**  
"Proud... at this hour... ungrateful brat..."

_At the harbor, the scene is bustling with activity. Older fishermen families are saying tearful goodbyes to their beloved ones, while others load cargo - food, supplies, and equipment onto various boats. The journey will last about two weeks._

**Mentor (looking up at the sky with exasperation):**  
"Why are you doing this to me? Is this payback for my previous life? Did I do something horrible to be treated like thisâ€”"

**MC's Father (arriving with a group of what appear to be big, drunk sailors, though he himself remains composed):**  
"I see you arrived early, son."

**Mentor (cutting him off angrily):**  
"THIS DAMN BRAT WAKES ME UP IN THE HOUR OF THE TIGER JUST SO HE CAN ARRIVE BEFORE YOU! WHY IS THE BAEK FAMILY SO STUBBORN?!"

**MC's Father (laughing and ignoring the mentor's rambling):**  
"Well, enthusiasm is a good trait for a warrior. Come, let's board."
