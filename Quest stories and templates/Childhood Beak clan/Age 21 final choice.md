## The Tragic News

_The Clan Leader approaches slowly, his expression grave. The Old Mentor looks up from his meditation._

**Clan Leader** _(calmly, but with deep sorrow)_:  
"I'm sorry. Your father... he won't be coming back from his fishing expedition."

**MC**: "What? No... that can't be right. He said he'd be back by sunset..."

**Clan Leader**: "The storm that hit three days ago was fiercer than anyone expected. We found pieces of his boat washed up on the eastern shore this morning."

**MC** _(shaking head)_: "No! He's probably just taking shelter somewhere! He knows those waters better than anyone!"

## The Mentor's Harsh Wisdom

**Old Mentor** _(gruffly)_:  
"You brat, calm down. He is where he belongs now. It's a good thing that the sea took him - better the sea than pirates."

**MC** _(angrily turning to mentor)_: "Master! How can you say that?!"

**Old Mentor** _(unmoved by the outburst)_:  
"You'll realize this when you grow older, but all people have their end. Only the deities are forever."

_The MC's anger slowly deflates into quiet grief._

## The Clan's Ultimatum

**Clan Leader** _(stepping forward, placing a hand on MC's shoulder)_:  
"Young man, your father is gone - be it for better or worse how he died, he is gone. Now it's up to you if you want to take his place or leave the clan."

**MC**: "Why can't I just stay here with Master? I don't want any position, I just want to keep training..."

**Old Mentor** _(interrupting)_:  
"Of course you can't, you brat! You have no more family. You know the clan rules - if the Second-in-Command dies, either their child takes over or the family is banished. It's a cruel rule, but it makes sure none try to take over the Clan Leader's place."

**MC**: "But Master, you know I don't want the Clan Leader's place! I just want to live like thisâ€”"

**Old Mentor** _(cutting him off, raising his voice)_:  
"I KNOW YOU BRAT, BUT STILL IT'S THE RULE! If it's ignored here, then others might take advantage of that, thinking our clan is weak. I am sorry, brat, but you must choose - stay and become Second-in-Command, or leave and write your own story."

## Support and Understanding

**Clan Leader**: "Nobody will judge you whatever you choose."

**Old Mentor** _(softening slightly)_:  
"I will support you the best way I can. I have ties to most clans and even the Empire - made them when your grandfather was alive, in case things went wrong with the clan back then. But I can use one of them for you, so I can get you in wherever you want to go."

## Closing

**Old Mentor** _(regardless of choice)_:  
"Whatever you choose, brat, remember what I taught you. Strength isn't just in your fists - it's in knowing when to use them."

_He looks toward the horizon where storm clouds are clearing._

**Old Mentor**: "Your father lived his life simply, and the sea took him simply. There are worse fates in this world."

_The tutorial concludes as the MC faces their first real choice, with the weight of loss and the promise of an uncertain future ahead..._
