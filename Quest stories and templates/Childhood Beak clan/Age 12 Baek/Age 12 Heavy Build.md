**MC (now noticeably taller, approaching the training grounds with his mentor):**  
"I can't believe Father's gone on another expedition already. Feels like he just got back."

**Mentor (grumbling as they walk):**  
"Hmph. That's the life of a second in command, brat. The sea doesn't wait for anyone, not even for his son's training."

**MC:**  
"I'm not a brat anymore, Master. I'm twelve now."

**Mentor (snorting):**  
"Twelve? Still a child in my eyes. You've grown a few inches, I'll give you that, but you're still the same reckless little troublemaker who climbed out windows."

**MC (protesting):**  
"That was two years ago!"

**Mentor:**  
"Two years, two minutes, makes no difference. Once a brat, always a brat."

_As they reach the training grounds, the mentor's expression grows more serious._

**Mentor:**  
"But even brats need to learn how to defend themselves and their clan. Your father may not be here, but your training can't wait."

_He gestures toward the practice dummies set up in the sand pit._

**Mentor:**  
"Today, you hold your first real weapon. Not wooden practice swords, not training sticks. Actual clan weapons, just blunted for safety."

**MC (eyes lighting up with excitement):**  
"Real weapons? Finally!"

**Mentor (firmly):**  
"Don't get too excited, child. I warned u already a weapon is a responsibility, not a toy. It represents our clan's honor, our ancestors' legacy, and your duty to protect those who cannot protect themselves."

_He moves toward the weapon racks._

**Mentor:**  
"Now, based on your... particular tendencies that you showed two years ago, let's start with the weapons that suit your nature."

**Mentor (handing MC a practice polearm and wooden shield):**  
"After that mountain climb two years ago, I can see you have the determination for steady, methodical fighting. These suit you better."

**MC (feeling the weight of the polearm):**  
"It's heavier than I thought it would be."

**Mentor:**  
"Good! Heavy weapons teach discipline. You can't rely on quick tricks - every move must be deliberate and powerful. Now, basic strike."

### **Strike Training (Normal Attack)**

**Mentor:**  
"Plant your feet like roots in the earth. The polearm is an extension of your body - feel its weight, don't fight it."

_MC's first strike nearly knocks him off balance._

**Mentor:**  
"Steady! You're not swinging a stick, you're wielding a weapon of war! Use your legs, not just your arms!"

_Strike 4..._

**Mentor:**  
"Better! I can see you remembering that mountain climb - same determination, same refusal to give up!"

_Strike 8..._

**Mentor:**  
"There! That strike had real power behind it. You're starting to understand weight and momentum!"

_Strike 10..._

**Mentor:**  
"Good enough. You're not falling over anymore, and that last strike would actually hurt someone. Progress."

### **Slash Training (Heavy Attack)**

**Mentor:**  
"Slashing with a polearm is about creating space and controlling the battlefield. Wide, sweeping arcs that keep enemies at distance."

_He demonstrates a devastating horizontal sweep._

**Mentor:**  
"See the range? No one can get close to you if you master this. But it requires perfect footwork. Try it."

_Slash 2..._

**MC (stumbling slightly):**  
"The momentum keeps pulling me around!"

**Mentor:**  
"That's why we train, brat! Learn to control the weapon, don't let it control you! Again!"

_Slash 6..._

**Mentor:**  
"Much better! You're starting to move with the weapon instead of against it!"

_Slash 10..._

**Mentor:**  
"Well, at least you hit the target. And you managed not to fall flat on your face. I call that a victory."

### **Thrust Training (Baek Unique - Defense Breaker)**

**Mentor:**  
"The thrust is where heavy weapons truly shine. All that weight and momentum focused into a single, unstoppable point."

**MC:**  
"It feels different from the slashes."

**Mentor:**  
"Because it is different! This isn't about sweeping - it's about driving forward like an avalanche. Unstoppable, inevitable."

_Thrust 2..._

**Mentor:**  
"Good! You're learning to use your whole body as a weapon! That mountain-climbing strength is showing!"

_Thrust 4..._

**Mentor:**  
"Excellent! I can see the same determination that got you up that cliff! Don't stop now!"

_Thrust 5..._

**MC (with a thunderous thrust that seems to shake the ground):**  
"How was that?!"

_CRASH! The straw dummy explodes in a shower of straw and splinters._

**MC (grinning proudly, looking to his mentor):**  
"I destroyed it completely! Look at all that straw!"

**Mentor (calmly drawing his sword):**  
"Destroyed? Let me show you what true destruction looks like, child."

_One effortless swing cuts the wooden foundation in half with surgical precision, each strand of remaining straw falling in perfect, measured pieces._

**MC (stunned):**  
"That was... how did you make it look so easy?"

**Mentor:**  
"Because I've learned that true power isn't about force, brat. It's about control. Remember that."

**Universal Ending After Training:**

**Mentor (watching MC practice, grudgingly impressed but not showing it):**  
"Hmph. Not completely hopeless, I suppose. For a brat."

**MC (panting from exertion but grinning):**  
"Did I do well, Master?"

**Mentor (turning away to hide a small smile):**  
"You did... adequately. Don't let it go to your head, child. This is just the beginning."

**MC:**  
"When will I be ready for real combat?"

**Mentor (his voice softening slightly, though still gruff):**  
"When you stop being a reckless brat and start thinking like a warrior. That day may come... eventually."

_As they pack up the training weapons, the mentor's expression grows thoughtful._

**Mentor:**  
"Your father would be proud of your progress today. But don't expect me to tell him that."

**MC (smiling):**  
"I won't, Master."

**Mentor (grumbling as they head home):**  
"Good. Now come on, brat. We have books to read about proper weapon maintenance. And don't even think about climbing out any windows tonight."
