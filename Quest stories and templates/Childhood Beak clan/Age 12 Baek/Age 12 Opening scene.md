## **Age 12:  Opening Scene**

**MC (practically bouncing with excitement as he gets ready):**  
"I can't believe it! Today I finally get to use real weapons! Actual clan weapons!"

**Mentor (sternly):**  
"Calm down, brat. A weapon isn't a toy to get excited about. It's a tool of responsibility."

**MC (still grinning as they head toward the door):**  
"But Master, I've been waiting for this day since I was ten! Real steel, real training!"

**Mentor (grabbing MC's shoulder to stop his eager rushing):**  
"Listen to me, child. I don't want to see that foolish excitement. Weapons are serious business."

_As they walk through the streets toward the training grounds, the mentor's expression grows thoughtful._

**Mentor:**  
"You know, I was about your age when I first held a real weapon. Fourteen, actually. Your grandfather was teaching me."

**MC (curious, his excitement settling into interest):**  
"Grandfather taught you? What was he like as a teacher?"

**Mentor (chuckling):**  
"Ha! Your grandfather was twelve years old and already better with a blade than men twice his age. But you know what's funny?"

**MC:**  
"What?"

**Mentor:**  
"He hated weapons. Absolutely despised them. Called them 'tools of unnecessary violence' and complained every time he had to pick one up."

**MC (surprised):**  
"But... but he was so good at fighting! All the stories sayâ€”"

**Mentor (his voice growing more serious):**  
"That's exactly the point, brat. Later in life, your grandfather used those same weapons he hated to protect the people of this town. Saved countless lives with the skills he never wanted to learn."

_They reach the training grounds entrance._

**Mentor (stopping and looking directly at MC):**  
"Remember this, child - weapons should only ever be used for one reason: to protect people who cannot protect themselves. That's the only justification for learning to kill."

**MC (sobered by the gravity in his mentor's voice):**  
"I understand, Master."

**Mentor:**  
"Good. Now let's see if you can channel that excitement into discipline."
