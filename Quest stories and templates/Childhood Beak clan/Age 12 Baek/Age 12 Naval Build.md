**MC (now noticeably taller, approaching the training grounds with his mentor):**  
"I can't believe Father's gone on another expedition already. Feels like he just got back."

**Mentor (grumbling as they walk):**  
"Hmph. That's the life of a second in command, brat. The sea doesn't wait for anyone, not even for his son's training."

**MC:**  
"I'm not a brat anymore, Master. I'm twelve now."

**Mentor (snorting):**  
"Twelve? Still a child in my eyes. You've grown a few inches, I'll give you that, but you're still the same reckless little troublemaker who climbed out windows."

**MC (protesting):**  
"That was two years ago!"

**Mentor:**  
"Two years, two minutes, makes no difference. Once a brat, always a brat."

_As they reach the training grounds, the mentor's expression grows more serious._

**Mentor:**  
"But even brats need to learn how to defend themselves and their clan. Your father may not be here, but your training can't wait."

_He gestures toward the practice dummies set up in the sand pit._

**Mentor:**  
"Today, you hold your first real weapon. Not wooden practice swords, not training sticks. Actual clan weapons, just blunted for safety."

**MC (eyes lighting up with excitement):**  
"Real weapons? Finally!"

**Mentor (firmly):**  
"Don't get too excited, child. I warned u already a weapon is a responsibility, not a toy. It represents our clan's honor, our ancestors' legacy, and your duty to protect those who cannot protect themselves."

_He moves toward the weapon racks._

**Mentor:**  
"Now, based on your... particular tendencies that you showed two years ago, let's start with the weapons that suit your nature."

**Mentor (handing MC a traditional practice spear and chain):**  
"Since you were so interested in watching real warriors two years ago, let's teach you their traditional methods properly."

**MC (examining the spear and chain):**  
"This is exactly like what the warriors were using!"

**Mentor:**  
"Exactly. This is the heart of our clan's fighting tradition - elegant, deadly, and steeped in honor. Now, basic strike."

### **Strike Training (Normal Attack)**

**Mentor:**  
"The spear is about precision, not power. Every strike should be exact, purposeful. Hold it like this - firm but not rigid."

_MC's first attempt is clumsy and off-target._

**Mentor:**  
"Focus, child! You're not just stabbing randomly - you're carrying on centuries of tradition! Aim for the center!"

_Strike 3..._

**Mentor:**  
"Better! I can see you remembering the forms you watched that night. Channel that memory!"

_Strike 7..._

**Mentor:**  
"Good! That strike had real technique behind it. You're learning to fight like a true warrior!"

_Strike 10..._

**Mentor:**  
"Good enough. You're starting to show some actual skill instead of just enthusiasm."

### **Slash Training (Heavy Attack)**

**Mentor:**  
"The chain adds complexity - it's not just about the spear anymore, it's about controlling two weapons as one system."

_He demonstrates a flowing combination where spear and chain move in harmony._

**Mentor:**  
"See how they work together? The chain can bind, the spear can strike. But timing is everything."

_Slash 2..._

**MC (chain wrapping around his own spear):**  
"This is really complicated!"

**Mentor:**  
"Of course it is! This is the weapon of master warriors, not children! Untangle yourself and focus!"

_Slash 6..._

**Mentor:**  
"There! You're beginning to understand the rhythm. The chain follows the spear, not the other way around!"

_Slash 10..._

**Mentor:**  
"Well, at least you hit the target. And the chain didn't tie you in knots this time. Small victories."

### **Thrust Training (Baek Unique - Defense Breaker)**

**Mentor:**  
"This is the true art - using the chain to bind your enemy's weapon while the spear finds its mark. It's what makes our clan's style unique."

**MC:**  
"So the chain traps them and the spear finishes them?"

**Mentor:**  
"Precisely! It requires perfect coordination, but when done right, no defense can stop it."

_Thrust 2..._

**Mentor:**  
"Excellent! You're showing real understanding of our fighting philosophy!"

_Thrust 4..._

**Mentor:**  
"Beautiful! That combination would make our ancestors proud! One more!"

_Thrust 5..._

**MC (executing a perfect bind-and-thrust combination):**  
"Did I do it right?!"

_CRASH! The straw dummy explodes as the chain binds it and the spear pierces through._

**MC (beaming with pride, looking to his mentor):**  
"I got it! I actually did the real technique!"

**Mentor (drawing his sword with a knowing smile):**  
"Real technique? Allow me to demonstrate what mastery actually looks like, brat."

_With one fluid motion, he cuts through the wooden foundation so cleanly that the straw falls in perfect geometric patterns, each piece precisely the same size._

**MC (awestruck):**  
"Master... that was incredible. Will I ever be that good?"

**Mentor:**  
"Perhaps, child. If you stop being satisfied with 'good enough' and start reaching for perfection. That's the way of a true warrior."

**Universal Ending After Training:**

**Mentor (watching MC practice, grudgingly impressed but not showing it):**  
"Hmph. Not completely hopeless, I suppose. For a brat."

**MC (panting from exertion but grinning):**  
"Did I do well, Master?"

**Mentor (turning away to hide a small smile):**  
"You did... adequately. Don't let it go to your head, child. This is just the beginning."

**MC:**  
"When will I be ready for real combat?"

**Mentor (his voice softening slightly, though still gruff):**  
"When you stop being a reckless brat and start thinking like a warrior. That day may come... eventually."

_As they pack up the training weapons, the mentor's expression grows thoughtful._

**Mentor:**  
"Your father would be proud of your progress today. But don't expect me to tell him that."

**MC (smiling):**  
"I won't, Master."

**Mentor (grumbling as they head home):**  
"Good. Now come on, brat. We have books to read about proper weapon maintenance. And don't even think about climbing out any windows tonight."
