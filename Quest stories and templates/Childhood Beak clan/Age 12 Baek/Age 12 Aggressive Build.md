**MC (now noticeably taller, approaching the training grounds with his mentor):**  
"I can't believe Father's gone on another expedition already. Feels like he just got back."

**Mentor (grumbling as they walk):**  
"Hmph. That's the life of a second in command, brat. The sea doesn't wait for anyone, not even for his son's training."

**MC:**  
"I'm not a brat anymore, Master. I'm twelve now."

**Mentor (snorting):**  
"Twelve? Still a child in my eyes. You've grown a few inches, I'll give you that, but you're still the same reckless little troublemaker who climbed out windows."

**MC (protesting):**  
"That was two years ago!"

**Mentor:**  
"Two years, two minutes, makes no difference. Once a brat, always a brat."

_As they reach the training grounds, the mentor's expression grows more serious._

**Mentor:**  
"But even brats need to learn how to defend themselves and their clan. Your father may not be here, but your training can't wait."

_He gestures toward the practice dummies set up in the sand pit._

**Mentor:**  
"Today, you hold your first real weapon. Not wooden practice swords, not training sticks. Actual clan weapons, just blunted for safety."

**MC (eyes lighting up with excitement):**  
"Real weapons? Finally!"

**Mentor (firmly):**  
"Don't get too excited, child. I warned u already a weapon is a responsibility, not a toy. It represents our clan's honor, our ancestors' legacy, and your duty to protect those who cannot protect themselves."

_He moves toward the weapon racks._

**Mentor:**  
"Now, based on your... particular tendencies that you showed two years ago, let's start with the weapons that suit your nature."

**Mentor (handing MC twin wooden harpoons with practice rope):**  
"Given how you snuck through those streets two years ago, you clearly favor speed and cunning. These are for you."

**MC (examining the twin harpoons):**  
"They're lighter than I expected."

**Mentor:**  
"That's the point, brat. Aggressive fighters rely on quick strikes, not brute force. Now, let's start with the basic strike."

### **Strike Training (Normal Attack)**

**Mentor:**  
"Feet shoulder-width apart. Hold the harpoons like this - loose grip, wrists flexible. You're not trying to stab a whale, you're trying to hit fast and move."

_MC attempts the first strike, nearly dropping one harpoon._

**Mentor (sighing):**  
"No, no, no! You're gripping too tight! Relax your hands, let the weapons flow. Again!"

_Strike 3..._

**Mentor:**  
"Better, but your stance is all wrong. You look like you're about to fall over. Plant your feet!"

_Strike 6..._

**Mentor:**  
"There! You see how that felt different? That's what speed looks like. Keep that rhythm!"

_Strike 10..._

**Mentor:**  
"Good enough. At least you're not dropping them anymore. Now let's move to slashing."

### **Slash Training (Heavy Attack)**

**Mentor:**  
"Slashing with harpoons isn't about cutting - it's about using the rope to control distance and create openings. Watch."

_He demonstrates a fluid slash that makes the rope sing through the air._

**Mentor:**  
"See how I use my whole body? The power comes from your core, not your arms. Try it."

_Slash 3..._

**MC (rope tangling around his legs):**  
"This is harder than it looks!"

**Mentor:**  
"Of course it is, brat! You think our ancestors mastered this overnight? Untangle yourself and try again!"

_Slash 7..._

**Mentor:**  
"Better! You're starting to understand the rhythm. The rope is your friend, not your enemy!"

_Slash 10..._

**Mentor:**  
"Well, at least you hit the target. And you're not tied up in your own ropes. Progress."

### **Thrust Training (Baek Unique - Defense Breaker)**

**Mentor:**  
"Now for the thrust - our clan's signature move. This breaks through any defense, but it requires perfect timing and commitment."

**MC:**  
"How is it different from a regular thrust?"

**Mentor:**  
"Watch closely. You throw both harpoons simultaneously, crossing the ropes to create a bind. It's not just about piercing - it's about trapping and overwhelming."

_Thrust 1..._

**Mentor:**  
"No! You threw them like you're fishing! This is combat! Put your whole body behind it!"

_Thrust 3..._

**Mentor:**  
"Better! I can see the killer instinct starting to show. Your street-smart nature is coming through!"

_Thrust 5..._

**MC (with a powerful crossed thrust):**  
"Like that?"

_CRASH! The straw dummy explodes, sending straw flying everywhere._

**MC (eyes wide with excitement, looking at his mentor for approval):**  
"Did you see that?! I completely destroyed it!"

**Mentor (drawing his sword with a slight smirk):**  
"Destroyed? Child, let me show you what 'destroyed' actually means."

_With one effortless, fluid swing, he cuts the remaining wooden foundation completely in half. The cut is so clean and precise that each piece of straw falls in perfectly measured sections, every strand cut to millimeter precision._

**MC (jaw dropping):**  
"How... how did you...?"

**Mentor (sheathing his sword):**  
"Years of practice, brat. Years of not being satisfied with 'good enough.' Remember this moment - there's always someone better, always more to learn."

**Universal Ending After Training:**

**Mentor (watching MC practice, grudgingly impressed but not showing it):**  
"Hmph. Not completely hopeless, I suppose. For a brat."

**MC (panting from exertion but grinning):**  
"Did I do well, Master?"

**Mentor (turning away to hide a small smile):**  
"You did... adequately. Don't let it go to your head, child. This is just the beginning."

**MC:**  
"When will I be ready for real combat?"

**Mentor (his voice softening slightly, though still gruff):**  
"When you stop being a reckless brat and start thinking like a warrior. That day may come... eventually."

_As they pack up the training weapons, the mentor's expression grows thoughtful._

**Mentor:**  
"Your father would be proud of your progress today. But don't expect me to tell him that."

**MC (smiling):**  
"I won't, Master."

**Mentor (grumbling as they head home):**  
"Good. Now come on, brat. We have books to read about proper weapon maintenance. And don't even think about climbing out any windows tonight."
