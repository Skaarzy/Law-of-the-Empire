**MC's Father:**  
"Now that you can feel the Sea Qi, I'll teach you the three fundamental techniques that every Baek warrior must master. These form the foundation of our fighting style."

### **Tidal Wave Training**

**MC's Father (demonstrating with his sword):**  
"First technique - Tidal Wave. A swing motion attack that pushes enemies back using Sea Qi force. Watch the flow of energy as I swing."

_He performs a wide sweeping motion, and a visible wave of sea-green energy ripples outward from his blade._

**MC's Father:**  
"The key is to let the Sea Qi build up during the swing and release it at the moment of impact. Try it."

_MC draws his harpoons, now glowing with faint sea-green energy._

**MC (attempting the technique):**  
"Like this?"

_He swings both harpoons in a wide arc, and a small wave of energy pushes outward._

**MC's Father:**  
"Good! For twin weapons, you can create a double wave effect. Again!"

### **Sea Storm Training**

**MC's Father:**  
"Second technique - Sea Storm. A piercing attack where qi forms a small tornado around the weapon before striking. Focus the energy to spiral around your harpoons."

_MC attempts the technique, and small whirlwinds begin to form around his harpoon tips._

**MC:**  
"I can see the tornado effect! It's like the qi is alive!"

### **Deep Current Strike Training**

**MC's Father:**  
"Third technique - Deep Current Strike. Strike with both harpoons from the hips using the sides to lift the enemy upward, then slam them down. Channel the Sea Qi into an upward surge."

_MC practices the motion, lifting imaginary enemies with the force of his sea-enhanced strike._

**MC's Father:**  
"Excellent! You're learning faster than I expected. Your aggressive fighting style suits these techniques well."

**Mentor (approaching with a knowing grin):**  
"Well, well. Look who's been doing his homework. I've been researching some additional techniques in the old clan scrolls while you two were bonding."

**MC:**  
"Additional techniques, Master?"

**Mentor:**  
"That's right, brat. Your father taught you the foundation, but there are more advanced techniques that each fighting style can learn. Let me guide you through them."

**Mentor:**  
"For aggressive fighters like you, I found six specialized techniques in the archives:"

1. **Riptide Barrage** - "Rapid alternating strikes - keep the pressure constant like a raging current."
2. **Hunter's Return** - "Throw both harpoons, then pull them back through your enemies. Devastating."
3. **Current Dash** - "Use Sea Qi to enhance your speed. You'll move like flowing water."
4. **Twin Cyclone** - "Swing both harpoons around, creating a tornado look. Impressive and deadly."
5. **Piercing Gale** - "A thrown harpoon technique that ignores armor completely."
6. **Whirlwind Recall** - "Throw in a wide arc, pull back to hit enemies from behind. Tricky but effective."

**Mentor:**  
"Practice these, and you'll be unstoppable in close combat."

**MC's Father (drawing his sword with a smile):**  
"You've learned well, son. But theory and practice are different things. Let's see how you handle yourself in a real fight."

**Mentor (getting excited and shouting from the sidelines):**  
"Beat that old man for me, brat! I'm not allowed to fight him myself, so you do it!"

**MC's Father (laughing):**  
"'Old man'? I'll show you who's old!"

_The sparring match begins, with MC using his newly learned Sea Qi techniques against his father's masterful swordplay._

**MC (fighting with determination):**  
"I won't hold back, Father!"

**MC's Father:**  
"Good! A true warrior never holds back!"

_After an intense battle using all his new techniques, MC manages to land the decisive blow._

**MC's Father (breathing hard but smiling with pride):**  
"Incredible! You've not only mastered the techniques, but you've made them your own. I'm truly proud of you, son."

**Mentor (cheering loudly):**  
"Ha! I knew the brat had it in him! That'll teach you to underestimate our training!"

**MC's Father (to MC):**  
"You've proven yourself worthy of our clan's highest honor. Go to the clan forge and speak with Master Smith Chen. Tell him I sent you to receive your true weapons."

**MC's Father:**  
"For aggressive fighters, Master Chen will forge you the Twin Tide Harpoons - weapons that enhance your throwing techniques and Sea Qi flow."

**MC (bowing deeply):**  
"Thank you, Father. I won't disappoint our clan."

**Mentor (gruffly but with obvious pride):**  
"About time you stopped being a complete disappointment, brat. Now you're just a partial disappointment."

**MC (grinning):**  
"I'll take that as high praise coming from you, Master."
