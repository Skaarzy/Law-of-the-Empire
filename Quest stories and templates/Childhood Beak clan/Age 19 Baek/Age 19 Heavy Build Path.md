**MC's Father:**  
"Now that you can feel the Sea Qi, I'll teach you the three fundamental techniques that every Baek warrior must master. These form the foundation of our fighting style."

### **Tidal Wave Training**

**MC's Father (demonstrating with his sword):**  
"First technique - Tidal Wave. A swing motion attack that pushes enemies back using Sea Qi force. Watch the flow of energy as I swing."

_He performs a wide sweeping motion, and a visible wave of sea-green energy ripples outward from his blade._

**MC's Father:**  
"The key is to let the Sea Qi build up during the swing and release it at the moment of impact. Try it."

_MC hefts his polearm, the weapon now surrounded by a steady blue-green aura._

**MC (swinging the heavy weapon):**  
"The weight feels different now - like it's supported by the sea itself."

**MC's Father:**  
"Exactly! Heavy weapons channel Sea Qi like the deep ocean - powerful and patient. Your Tidal Wave will have more force than any other build."

### **Sea Storm Training**

**MC's Father:**  
"For polearms, the Sea Storm creates a larger tornado around the tip. The heavier the weapon, the more devastating the pierce."

_MC thrusts forward, and a substantial whirlwind forms around his polearm tip._

### **Deep Current Strike Training**

**MC's Father:**  
"Your Deep Current Strike is the most powerful - use the polearm's length and your strength to launch enemies high before crashing them down."

_MC practices the upward strike, the sea energy amplifying his natural power._

**MC's Father:**  
"Perfect! Your methodical approach combined with Sea Qi makes you nearly unstoppable."

**Mentor (approaching with a knowing grin):**  
"Well, well. Look who's been doing his homework. I've been researching some additional techniques in the old clan scrolls while you two were bonding."

**MC:**  
"Additional techniques, Master?"

**Mentor:**  
"That's right, brat. Your father taught you the foundation, but there are more advanced techniques that each fighting style can learn. Let me guide you through them."

**Mentor:**  
"For heavy fighters, I found techniques that match your methodical approach:"

1. **Crushing Depths** - "Overhead strikes with the force of the deep ocean. Nothing can withstand this."
2. **Fortress Wall** - "Defensive stance that blocks everything and counters automatically."
3. **Undertow Sweep** - "Ground-level sweep that knocks down multiple enemies at once."
4. **Mountain Tide** - "Slow but absolutely unstoppable forward thrust. Patience rewarded."
5. **Deep Anchor** - "Plant your polearm and become an immovable defensive position."
6. **Tsunami Crash** - "Jumping attack that creates shockwaves on impact. Devastating area effect."

**Mentor:**  
"Master these, and you'll be an unstoppable force on any battlefield."

**MC's Father (drawing his sword with a smile):**  
"You've learned well, son. But theory and practice are different things. Let's see how you handle yourself in a real fight."

**Mentor (getting excited and shouting from the sidelines):**  
"Beat that old man for me, brat! I'm not allowed to fight him myself, so you do it!"

**MC's Father (laughing):**  
"'Old man'? I'll show you who's old!"

_The sparring match begins, with MC using his newly learned Sea Qi techniques against his father's masterful swordplay._

**MC (fighting with determination):**  
"I won't hold back, Father!"

**MC's Father:**  
"Good! A true warrior never holds back!"

_After an intense battle using all his new techniques, MC manages to land the decisive blow._

**MC's Father (breathing hard but smiling with pride):**  
"Incredible! You've not only mastered the techniques, but you've made them your own. I'm truly proud of you, son."

**Mentor (cheering loudly):**  
"Ha! I knew the brat had it in him! That'll teach you to underestimate our training!"

**MC's Father (to MC):**  
"You've proven yourself worthy of our clan's highest honor. Go to the clan forge and speak with Master Smith Chen. Tell him I sent you to receive your true weapons."

**MC's Father:**  
"For heavy fighters, you'll receive the Deep Current Polearm - a weapon that channels the ocean's crushing power through every strike."

**MC (bowing deeply):**  
"Thank you, Father. I won't disappoint our clan."

**Mentor (gruffly but with obvious pride):**  
"About time you stopped being a complete disappointment, brat. Now you're just a partial disappointment."

**MC (grinning):**  
"I'll take that as high praise coming from you, Master."
