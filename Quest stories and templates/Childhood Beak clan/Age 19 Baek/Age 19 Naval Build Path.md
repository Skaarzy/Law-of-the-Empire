**MC's Father:**  
"Now that you can feel the Sea Qi, I'll teach you the three fundamental techniques that every Baek warrior must master. These form the foundation of our fighting style."

### **Tidal Wave Training**

**MC's Father (demonstrating with his sword):**  
"First technique - Tidal Wave. A swing motion attack that pushes enemies back using Sea Qi force. Watch the flow of energy as I swing."

_He performs a wide sweeping motion, and a visible wave of sea-green energy ripples outward from his blade._

**MC's Father:**  
"The key is to let the Sea Qi build up during the swing and release it at the moment of impact. Try it."

_MC takes up his traditional clan weapons, both spear and chains now gleaming with ancestral energy._

**MC:**  
"These weapons... they feel like they're welcoming me home."

**MC's Father:**  
"That's our bloodline recognizing its true weapons. You're connecting with generations of Baek warriors."

### **Sea Storm Training**

**MC's Father:**  
"With spear and chains, Sea Storm becomes even more complex - the tornado forms around the spear while the chains create additional energy patterns."

_MC thrusts his spear while the chains move in harmony, creating intricate qi formations._

### **Deep Current Strike Training**

**MC's Father:**  
"Your Deep Current Strike uses both weapons - spear for the upward strike, chains for additional lifting force and the downward slam."

_MC executes the technique flawlessly, the traditional weapons moving as one._

**MC's Father:**  
"Outstanding! You fight exactly like your grandfather did. The clan traditions live on through you."

**Mentor (approaching with a knowing grin):**  
"Well, well. Look who's been doing his homework. I've been researching some additional techniques in the old clan scrolls while you two were bonding."

**MC:**  
"Additional techniques, Master?"

**Mentor:**  
"That's right, brat. Your father taught you the foundation, but there are more advanced techniques that each fighting style can learn. Let me guide you through them."

**Mentor:**  
"For traditional clan weapons, I found the most ancient techniques:"

1. **Serpent Coil** - "Chain wraps around enemies while spear strikes. Classic clan technique."
2. **Lightning Current** - "Sea Qi travels along chains to shock multiple enemies. Grandfather's favorite."
3. **Trident Dance** - "Flowing combination of spear and chain. Pure artistry in combat."
4. **Kraken's Grasp** - "Chains grab multiple enemies simultaneously. Control the battlefield."
5. **Maelstrom Strike** - "Spinning spear with chains creating wide attack area. Impossible to dodge."
6. **Depth Charge** - "Throw spear with chain, pull back with explosive force. Devastating ranged attack."

**Mentor:**  
"These are the techniques that made our clan legendary on the seas. Master them all."

**MC's Father (drawing his sword with a smile):**  
"You've learned well, son. But theory and practice are different things. Let's see how you handle yourself in a real fight."

**Mentor (getting excited and shouting from the sidelines):**  
"Beat that old man for me, brat! I'm not allowed to fight him myself, so you do it!"

**MC's Father (laughing):**  
"'Old man'? I'll show you who's old!"

_The sparring match begins, with MC using his newly learned Sea Qi techniques against his father's masterful swordplay._

**MC (fighting with determination):**  
"I won't hold back, Father!"

**MC's Father:**  
"Good! A true warrior never holds back!"

_After an intense battle using all his new techniques, MC manages to land the decisive blow._

**MC's Father (breathing hard but smiling with pride):**  
"Incredible! You've not only mastered the techniques, but you've made them your own. I'm truly proud of you, son."

**Mentor (cheering loudly):**  
"Ha! I knew the brat had it in him! That'll teach you to underestimate our training!"

**MC's Father (to MC):**  
"You've proven yourself worthy of our clan's highest honor. Go to the clan forge and speak with Master Smith Chen. Tell him I sent you to receive your true weapons."

**MC's Father:**  
"For traditional clan warriors, the ancestral Storm Spear and Tidal Chains await you - weapons passed down through generations of Baek warriors."

**MC (bowing deeply):**  
"Thank you, Father. I won't disappoint our clan."

**Mentor (gruffly but with obvious pride):**  
"About time you stopped being a complete disappointment, brat. Now you're just a partial disappointment."

**MC (grinning):**  
"I'll take that as high praise coming from you, Master."
