**Village Elder (standing on the pavilion platform, addressing the gathered crowd):**  
"Today we celebrate not just another birthday, but a true milestone! Our young warrior reaches his nineteenth year and undergoes the Rite of Passage!"

_The whole town has gathered at the central pavilion, with banners hanging from every post and tables laden with food and drink. The morning air is filled with laughter, music, and congratulations._

**MC (moving through the crowd, accepting well-wishes from various villagers):**  
"Thank you, Mrs. Chen! Yes, I can hardly believe I'm nineteen already!"

**Village Fisherman (raising his cup):**  
"To the young master! May the sea guide your path!"

**Merchant's Wife:**  
"Such a fine young man you've grown into! Your father must be so proud!"

**MC (grinning and making his way toward his mentor):**  
"Master, can you believe all this celebration? It feels like the whole world is here!"

**Mentor (grumbling but with a slight smile):**  
"Hmph. All this fuss over one brat turning nineteen. Back in my day, we just got a pat on the head and were told to get back to work."

**MC:**  
"Come on, Master! Even you have to admit this is exciting!"

**Mentor:**  
"Exciting? I suppose... for those who enjoy crowds, noise, and having their ears talked off by every fishwife in town."

_After hours of celebration, eating, drinking, and mingling with the villagers, MC is enjoying his freedom when the mentor approaches._

**Mentor (calling MC's to come to him):**  
"Alright, brat, enough fun and games. The Clan Leader wants to congratulate you personally. Come on."

**MC (disappointed):**  
"But Master, I was just getting to the good stories with Old Fisherman Wei!"

**Mentor:**  
"The stories can wait. When the Clan Leader calls, you answer. Now move."

_The mentor leads MC through the crowd toward where the Clan Leader waits._

**Clan Leader (greeting MC warmly as he approaches):**  
"Congratulations on reaching your nineteenth year, young nephew. You've grown into a fine young man."

**MC (bowing respectfully):**  
"Thank you for your kind words, Clan Leader."

**Clan Leader:**  
"Your dedication to training and your performance in real combat have not gone unnoticed. You've made our clan proud."

_After the personal congratulations, the Clan Leader steps onto the pavilion platform and addresses the gathered crowd._

**Clan Leader (his voice carrying across the pavilion):**  
"Everybody! Today marks not just a birthday, but a true milestone! Young MC has proven himself worthy of our clan's Sacred Qi techniques!"

_The crowd cheers as the Clan Leader continues._

**Clan Leader:**  
"By the ancient rites of our clan, I grant him permission to begin practicing the bloodline qi - the sacred Sea Qi that flows through Baek blood. May his training go successfully and may the sea accept him as one of its own, now go on continue this feast and let it last until the hour of the ox!! 

_The crowd cheers as the music continues_

**Clan Leader(stepping down and putting his hand on MC shoulder):**
"Your father will take you to the training grounds to see if you can awaken our sacred qi, good luck nephew."

_He turns to MC's father with a meaningful look._

**Clan Leader:**  
"Brother, take him to the Tide Shrine training grounds immediately. It's time to see if the sea accepts him."

**MC's Father (nodding solemnly):**  
"Of course. Come, son. This is the moment we've all been waiting for."

_As they prepare to leave, the mentor approaches with his usual complaints._

**Mentor (to MC's father):**  
"You might be useless at this, you know. Teaching bloodline techniques isn't the same as swinging a sword around. What if you can't teach the boy properly?"

**MC's Father (laughing and ignoring the comment):**  
"We'll manage just fine, old friend. Come along - I want you there to witness this."

_They make their way to the training grounds near the Tide Shrine._

## **The Training Location**

_The training area sits on a rocky outcropping where massive waves crash against stone ledges that have been visibly shaped by water over thousands of years. The constant sound of wind blowing mingles with the rhythmic formation of waves in the distance. Salt spray fills the air, and the ancient stones beneath their feet are worn smooth by countless tides._

**MC (looking around in awe):**  
"I've never been this close to the Tide shrine before. The sound of the waves... it's almost like they're calling to me."

**MC's Father:**  
"That's the Sea responding to your blood. Can you feel it, son? The power that flows between the ocean and our families blood?"

**Mentor (finding a comfortable spot to sit and watch):**  
"Well, don't just stand there gawking. Let's see if the boy has any real talent or if we've been wasting our time all these years."

**MC's Father (drawing his sword, and immediately a faint blue-green aura begins to shimmer around the blade):**  
"Watch carefully, son. Sea Qi isn't like normal cultivation energy. It comes from our connection to the ocean itself - the endless power of tides, currents, and storms."

_As he moves his sword through the air, trails of shimmering sea-green energy follow the blade's path, like luminous water flowing through the air.And the sea start to get restless_

**MC (mesmerized):**  
"It's... it's beautiful, Father. Like the sword is cutting through water itself."

**MC's Father:**  
"Now, close ur eyes and concentrate on the sound of waves splashing and the smell of the salty sea water try to feel the seas Qi and absorb it into ur blood making it  one with you."

**MC(concentrating):"**
Hmhp its moving around too much its like a current that is hudernet times faster than my blood its too much pressure.

**MC's Father(calmly):**
Slow down don't talk just concentrate on in don't try to control it just let if flow through you its going to find its own path.

_Here player must align the [[flow of the sea qi]]
 
**MC (now in a zen state):**
Yes! I feel i father its almost like sea waves are crashing trough my veins.

**MC's Father(Proud):**
Yes that is exactly it now open stand up and take your weapon and feel for the connection. Don't force it let the sea energy flow to you the weapon naturaly."
