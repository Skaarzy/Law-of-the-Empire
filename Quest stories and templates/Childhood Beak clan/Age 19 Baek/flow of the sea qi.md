 **Sea Qi Resonance Ritual — Refined System**

 **PHASE 1: Frequency Matching (Qi Tuning)**
- Player adjusts **amplitude** and **frequency** of their wave (via mouse/stick/dial)
- Goal: make the **player wave visually match** the Sea Qi wave above it

Once the two wave forms align **in shape and movement**, **Phase 2** begins.
**PHASE 2: Node Alignment (Qi Dot Sync)**

**New Layer Appears:**
- Both the **Sea Qi waveform** and the **Player Qi waveform** now have **“Qi Dots”** positioned along them.
- Example: 3–5 glowing orbs embedded in the curve
- These represent **flow nodes, meridian points**, or spiritual resonance points

**Goal:**
- Now the player must **adjust the horizontal position** (phase offset) of their waveform — so that the **Qi Dots on both waves line up perfectly** at the same points in the cycle.

Mechanic Detail:
- Think of it like **aligning constellations** or overlaying two musical beats until their _key notes_ match.
- You’re no longer changing shape — just **shifting** the player wave **left or right** to **sync the dots**.

Inputs:
- Mouse or stick:   
- **Phase 1:** Up/down to adjust frequency and amplitude        
- **Phase 2:** Left/right to align Qi Dot positions
- When all dots are close enough (like within magnetic lock distance), the waves **snap**, and the ritual completes.

✅ Success Feedback:

- Both waves fully merge: smooth, glowing pulse
- Dots form a **single bright constellation-like arc**
- Sound: a _multiple waves crash sounds_, with submerged singing bowls

 Failure Feedback:
- Dots misaligned = jagged sound, flickering visual
- Misalignment too long = need to restart Phase 2 or full ritual
