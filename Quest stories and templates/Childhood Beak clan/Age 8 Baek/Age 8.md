_The first rays of dawn creep through the shutters as you stir restlessly in your bed, caught between sleep and waking. Dreams of crashing waves fade as reality intrudes..._

**[MC jolts awake, drenched in sweat and breathing heavily]**

**Mentor (bellowing from downstairs, his voice echoing through the small house):**  
"Wake up, you worthless brat! It's already the hour of the snake! The sun's been up longer than you've been alive!"

**MC (rubbing his eyes, mumbling into his pillow):**  
"This old geezer can't even let me sleep in peace... just five more minutes..."

**Mentor (voice getting dangerously louder):**  
"I heard that, you lazy little punk! Get your bones moving before I come up there and move them for you!"

_The sound of heavy footsteps on the stairs makes you scramble out of bed._

**[MC stumbles downstairs, still half-asleep, yawning widely as he looks around the kitchen]**

**MC (blinking in confusion at the empty table):**  
"Hey... where's all the food? Don't tell me you ate everything again, you greedy old—"

**Mentor (cutting him off with a bark of laughter, crumbs still clinging to his beard):**  
"Hmph! What did you expect me to do, waste away waiting for your lazy ass to grace us with your presence? I'm old and frail, brat. If I miss a meal for even a minute, I might just keel over and die."

**MC (squinting at the mentor's robust frame, grumbling under his breath):**  
"Pretending to be weak and frail again, huh? You could probably arm-wrestle a bear and win..."

**Mentor (ears perking up, eyes twinkling with mischief):**  
"What was that? Speak up if you've got something to say! And don't test me, you little whelp. You think I'm putting on an act? You'd be lucky if I let you sleep past the hour of the snake any day this year."

**MC (stomach growling audibly):**  
"Yeah, yeah, I get it. You're the toughest old coot in the harbor and I'm just a lazy kid. Can we please eat something first? I'm starving over here."

**Mentor (suddenly serious, pointing toward the door with authority):**  
"Eat later. Today marks the beginning of your real education, brat. Time you learned the lay of the land of Saltspear Harbor, the training grounds, the docks, the people who matter and the ones who don't. You can't stay cooped up in this house forever like some pampered merchant's son."

**MC (shoulders sagging dramatically):**  
"Oh, wonderful. Forced sightseeing with an empty stomach. Just what every eight-year-old dreams of."

**Mentor (chuckling, but with steel beneath the humor):**  
"Stop your whining before I give you something real to complain about. Think of this as your first real training—your eyes and mind need sharpening just as much as your body will. Maybe more, considering how thick your skull seems to be."

**MC (sighing deeply, but straightening up with reluctant acceptance):**  
"Fine, fine. Lead the way, old man. But if I collapse from hunger, you're carrying me home."

**Mentor (grinning with genuine pride, though he tries to hide it):**  
"That's more like it! Shows you've got some backbone after all. Now move those feet—the world won't wait for you to catch up, and neither will I."

_As you both head toward the door, morning light streaming through the windows, you can't help but feel a mix of excitement and apprehension._

**MC (muttering as he follows, just loud enough to be heard):**  
"Sharpen eyes and mind at eight years old... what kind of childhood is this supposed to be?"

**Mentor (not even turning around, but his voice carrying clear amusement):**  
"I heard that too, you little grumbler. And it's the kind of childhood that'll keep you alive long enough to have grandchildren of your own to torment."

_The door swings open, revealing the bustling harbor beyond. Your real education is about to begin._
