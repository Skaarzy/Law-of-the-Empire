**Mentor (walking slowly, his weathered hand trailing along the stone wall):**  
"This forge is older than even my bones, and that's saying something. Made most of the blades in this town... broke most of them too, if I'm being honest."

**MC (covering nose, grumbling):**  
"Smells like burnt spit and rust."

**Mentor (chuckling gruffly):**  
"That's the smell of honest work, brat. You'll learn to love it when you finally earn your first real bruise. This very forge created your great-grandfather's blade‚Äîthe one that carved his legend into these stones. Respect this place, because one day it'll create yours as well."

_The mentor pauses, watching sparks fly from within. His eyes grow distant._

**Mentor:**  
"Every blade tells a story. Some sing of glory, others... well, others just rust away forgotten."

## ü™® **[2. Old Customs Post]**

**Mentor (snorting with disdain):**  
"Used to check goods here, back when merchants feared more than just losing coin. But after the empire implemented their precious guild office, this place became as useful as a broken net. Now it's just home to bugs, rats, and bitter memories."

**MC (eyeing the sagging roof):**  
"Looks like it'll collapse if I breathe too hard."

**Mentor (smirking):**  
"Ha! Wouldn't risk going anywhere near it, brat. Might land on that lazy head of yours, and then who'd I have to torment with wisdom?"

_A piece of rotted wood creaks ominously in the breeze._

**Mentor (more seriously):**  
"This place once decided the fate of caravans. Now look at it‚Äîempire's progress, they called it. Progress toward what, I wonder?"

---

## üßµ **[3. Net Mender's Yard]**

**Mentor (nodding respectfully toward the elderly workers):**  
"These old hands fix nets, stitch wounds, and weave gossip deadlier than any blade. Without this place, our town wouldn't have fish to eat or coin to spend."

**MC (watching the slow, methodical movements):**  
"They move even slower than you do."

**Mentor (sharp look, but not without warmth):**  
"Careful with that tongue, brat. Don't insult your elders, especially these ones‚Äîthey might just save your worthless life someday. Most warriors who survive their first real fight come crawling here to get their wounds stitched. Remember that when you're bleeding."

_An elderly woman looks up from her work and nods at the mentor, who touches his forehead in return._

**Mentor (quietly):**  
"Steady hands and patient hearts. Learn from them."

---

## üêü **[4. Fish-Gutting Pier]**

**Mentor (as gulls squawk and dive overhead):**  
"Mind your step here. Blood slick has killed more fools than sword points ever did. But it's also fed ten times as many."

**MC (stepping carefully, nose wrinkled):**  
"Who needs this much fish? What happens to all these guts?"

**Mentor (gesturing to the bustling workers):**  
"The whole harbor eats off this stink. Most of the guts become bait for the next catch, and the rest gets sold to traders who know what they're worth. Respect this place, or starve‚Äîsimple as that."

_A fisherman tosses entrails to the screaming gulls._

**Mentor:**  
"Life feeds on life, brat. Best learn that lesson young."

---

## üî• **[5. Smokehouse Row]**

**Mentor (waving smoke away from his face, a distant smile crossing his lips):**  
"Dried eel, squid, even sea wolf when the tides are generous. This smoke... it takes me back to when your grandfather and I would stumble here dead drunk in the middle of the night, looking for something to fill our bellies after losing our coin at dice."

**MC (coughing violently):**  
"Ugh! Smells like burnt leather!"

**Mentor (laughing despite himself):**  
"You're too spoiled, brat. This place makes the food that keeps fishermen alive at sea for months without seeing shore. These preserves have saved more lives than any sword‚Äîincluding mine, more times than I care to count."

_Smoke curls between the hanging fish like ghostly fingers._

**Mentor (more softly):**  
"Your grandfather could eat a whole smoked eel in one sitting. Claimed it gave him strength for the next day's catch."

---

## üêô **[6. The Eight-Legged Drum]**

**Mentor (nodding toward the weathered tavern, hand unconsciously touching an old scar on his jaw):**  
"Don't go in there unless you plan to leave with fewer teeth than you entered with. This place is where I got punched for the first time... ah, the memories."

**MC:**  
"Eight legs, no rules?"

**Mentor (grinning wickedly):**  
"One rule, and one rule only: don't talk big unless your fists can back up your mouth. You'll learn that lesson when you're old enough. For now, don't pay it any mind‚Äîit's a place for fools and drunks."

_Raucous laughter spills from within, followed by the sound of something breaking._

**Mentor:**  
"Though I'll admit, some of my best stories started in that cesspit."

---

## üìú **[7. Harbor Office]**

**Mentor (voice dripping with disgust):**  
"Guild records, tariffs, bribes... typical bureaucratic sludge. After this place was built, everything changed. Suddenly it was all about being 'proper' and having the empire's 'protection.' Bah! Still makes my stomach turn."

**MC:**  
"Did you ever work in there?"

**Mentor (bark of bitter laughter):**  
"Once! Your grandfather insisted, said it would 'help us build a good relationship with imperial authority.' Ha! I didn't last even a single day. Got thrown out for threatening a clerk with a soup spoon when he tried to tax the air we breathe."

_A well-dressed clerk hurries past, clutching scrolls._

**Mentor (spitting):**  
"Look at them scurry. Like rats in expensive clothes."

---

## üì¶ **[8. Geumhyang Trading Hall]**

**Mentor (lowering his voice, eyes narrowing):**  
"This place belongs to the Li Company. You need to know about them‚Äîthey started with nothing and built a trading empire that rivals the throne itself. Polished floors, expensive goods, and prices to match."

**MC:**  
"Looks... clean."

**Mentor (darkly):**  
"So do corpses, brat. Doesn't mean they're safe to touch. These bastards won't lift a finger to protect their own cargo unless you pay them double what it's worth. They worship coin above all else."

_Merchants in fine silks examine goods while guards watch with cold eyes._

**Mentor:**  
"Remember this: when dealing with the Li Company, count your fingers after every handshake."

---

## üåä **[9. Tide Shrine for Ancestors]**

**Mentor (stopping abruptly, his voice becoming reverent):**  
"Bow here. Don't ask questions. Just bow."

**MC (hesitating):**  
"Do you really believe in all this?"

**Mentor (after a long pause):**  
"I believe enough not to risk being cursed. Better safe than sorry, as they say. This shrine was built in the time of our ancestors‚Äîsome say the founder himself built it with his own blood and sweat poured into every stone. Most people here don't worship it anymore, but they respect it. For me, that's enough."

_The sound of gentle waves lapping against the shrine's base creates an almost hypnotic rhythm._

**Mentor (quietly):**  
"Your great-grandfather prayed here before every voyage. Came back from all of them... until the last."

---

## üßÇ **[10. Salt Works ‚Äì in the distance]**

**Mentor (pointing toward the shimmering heat haze):**  
"See that distortion in the air? Salt flats. Hot work, slow death, but honest living. Stay away from there and don't disturb them‚Äîthey're the ones sacrificing their souls so we can preserve our food."

**MC:**  
"I thought our people didn't fear sweat and hard work."

**Mentor (grimly):**  
"We don't fear honest work, but we all fear dying, and that place does more than dry salt‚Äîit dries the life right out of you. Those workers age a year for every season they spend out there."

_Tiny figures move like ghosts through the salt fields._

**Mentor:**  
"Respect them. They choose a hard path so others don't have to."

---

## üèÆ **[11. Red Lantern Street ‚Äì daytime]**

**Mentor (gazing at the unlit lanterns swaying in the breeze):**  
"These lanterns are ten times more beautiful at night, but also ten times more dangerous. This street has two faces: morning brings vendors and simple folk going about their business. When night falls... knives come out, and shady business begins."

**MC:**  
"I heard someone lost a hand for cheating at dice games here."

**Mentor (nodding grimly):**  
"He was lucky. Better to lose a hand and keep your life than the other way around. This is the only place your grandfather and father both hated with burning passion, but without it, this town would crumble to dust."

_A merchant hurriedly packs his stall as shadows begin to lengthen._

**Mentor:**  
"Every port needs its shadows, brat. Just make sure you never become one of them."

---

## ü•ã **[12. Outer Training Yard]**

**Mentor (stopping to watch disciples sparring with wooden swords):**  
"Steel means nothing without the skill to wield it. Even raw talent dies soft if it's not tempered by discipline. Training must be consistent‚Äîevery single day, without exception."

**MC (yawning):**  
"Hope they like collecting bruises."

**Mentor (chuckling):**  
"You'll be joining them in a couple of years, and they don't fear bruises‚Äîthey fear stagnation. Here's a tip from this old mentor: when you first step into that yard, bring a bucket of cold water. Trust me, you'll need it."

_The sound of wooden weapons clacking fills the air, punctuated by sharp commands from instructors._

**Mentor:**  
"Pain is temporary, brat. But the strength you build lasts a lifetime."

---

## üç∂ **[13. Final Stop ‚Äì The Weathered Anchor Tavern]**

**Mentor (pausing at the entrance, hand resting on the doorframe):**  
"This is where fools go to forget their troubles, and the wise go to listen to what those troubles really are. This place is where your father first got properly drunk... hah! You should have seen the bruises he sported when your grandfather found out!"

**MC:**  
"Sounds like you practically lived here."

**Mentor (grinning with genuine warmth):**  
"Lived here? I owned the stool by the door‚Äîthat one right there. None dare sit in it even now, and the tavern keeper still keeps it clean for me. Mark my words: if this old geezer is still breathing when you reach adulthood, I'll bring you here and pay for your first drink, just like I did for your father."

_The mentor's eyes grow misty for just a moment._

**Mentor:**  
"Some of the best conversations of my life happened on that stool. And some of the worst decisions too."

---

## üß† **Final Words Before the Journey Begins**

**Mentor (turning to face you directly, his weathered hands gripping your shoulders):**  
"Now open your eyes wide, brat. This harbor doesn't wait for slow minds or soft hearts. If you lower your guard or let laziness take root, the sea will swallow you whole‚Äîand it won't even bother to spit out the bones."

**MC (with newfound determination, though still grumbling):**  
"Sharpen eyes and mind... got it."

**Mentor (laughing heartily, the sound echoing off the harbor walls):**  
"Hah! Exactly! Annoying as it is, this wisdom will make your life easier, you stubborn brat. Now get yourself home and finish reading those books I gave you. I'll be testing you when you're done, and I promise you won't like my teaching methods if you haven't done the work."

_As the sun begins to set over the harbor, painting the water in shades of gold and crimson, the mentor watches you with pride hidden behind gruff affection._

**Mentor (quietly, more to himself than to you):**  
"Just like your father... and your grandfather before him. Maybe there's hope for this generation yet."
