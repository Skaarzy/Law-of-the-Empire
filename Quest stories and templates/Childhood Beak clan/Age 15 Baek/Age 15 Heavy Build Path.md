**Mentor:**  
"Good. Now let's get this over with so I can get back to more important things. Like my afternoon nap."

_As they reach the training grounds, the mentor kicks at the sand irritably._

**Mentor:**  
"'Just watch over him while I'm gone,' he says. 'Make sure he doesn't get into trouble,' he says. Does he think I'm some kind of nursemaid?"

**MC (trying not to smile):**  
"Well, you do make excellent rice porridge when I'm sick..."

**Mentor (whirling around with an angry glare):**  
"Don't push it, brat! Just because I've kept you alive this long doesn't mean I won't tan your hide right here and now!"

_He moves toward the weapon racks with exaggerated annoyance._

**Mentor:**  
"Now quit your smart mouth and grab your weapons. If I have to be here instead of catching fish, we're going to make the most of it. Time for some real sparring - dodging, parrying, and countering. Let's see if three years of training have made you anything more than a walking target."

## **Heavy Build Path (Polearm + Armor)**

**Mentor (hefting his practice sword):**  
"All that armor and that big stick, and you still move like you're stuck in mud. Let's see if you can at least avoid getting pummeled."

### **Dodge Training**

**Mentor:**  
"Heavy fighters can't rely on speed, so you need to read attacks early and move efficiently. No wasted motion."

_Dodge 3..._

**Mentor:**  
"Too slow! That armor won't save you if you can't get out of the way! Use your brain, not just your legs!"

_Dodge 7..._

**Mentor:**  
"Better! You're starting to move like you understand weight and momentum instead of fighting against them!"

_Dodge 12..._

**Mentor:**  
"At least you know how to not get hit. Though calling that lumbering 'dodging' is generous."

### **Parry Training**

**Mentor:**  
"Now let's see if that heavy polearm can actually stop an attack instead of just looking intimidating."

_Parry 4..._

**Mentor:**  
"I'm going easy on you, so don't get cocky, brat."

**MC (panting under the weight of his armor):**  
"This is going easy? What's going strong then?"

**Mentor (chuckling):**  
"Maybe someday you'll find out. When you can lift that polearm without looking like you're about to fall over."

_Parry 9..._

**Mentor:**  
"Good! You're using the weight of your weapon as an advantage instead of fighting it!"

_Parry 12..._

**Mentor:**  
"Not bad. Your heavy build is showing its strengths - when you connect a parry, you really stop an attack dead."

### **Counter Training**

**Mentor:**  
"Heavy weapons make the best counters - if you can time them right. All that power focused into one devastating response."

_Counter 2..._

**Mentor:**  
"Weak! You have all that mass behind you and you're fighting like a scared child!"

_Counter 4..._

**Mentor:**  
"There! That's what I'm talking about! Use that unstoppable momentum!"

_Counter 5..._

**MC (landing a thunderous counter that makes the ground shake):**  
"How was that?"

**Mentor (nodding slightly):**  
"Better. But you're still weak as a newborn whale calf. At least now you're a newborn whale calf with a big stick."

**Mentor (wiping sweat from his brow and looking tired):**  
"Enough. I'm too old for this nonsense, and my bones are aching. All this training has made me thirsty."

_He sheathes his practice sword and stretches his back with an audible crack._

**Mentor:**  
"Go to The Iron Carp Bowl and bring me some rice wine. The good stuff, not the swill they serve to the dock workers."

**MC (looking indignant):**  
"What? I'm not your servant, Master! Get your own wine!"

**Mentor (his voice rising to a roar):**  
"I thought you said you know all about combat now! But you can't even handle a simple task like fetching rice wine for your tired old teacher?! You lazy brat!"

**MC (backing away with hands raised):**  
"Alright, alright! I'll get your wine! But I'm not carrying it back if you drink too much and pass out again!"

**Mentor (grumbling as he sits down heavily on a training bench):**  
"Ungrateful whelp... in my day, students showed respect to their elders... mumble mumble... lazy youth these days..."
