**MC (practically bouncing with excitement as he grabs his weapons):**  
"Finally! Real sparring today! Not just hitting dummies or practicing forms - actual combat training!"

**Mentor (sitting in his chair, not moving, looking thoroughly annoyed):**  
"Oh, wonderful. The youngster is excited. Do you know what I could be doing right now instead of teaching you how to not get yourself killed?"

**MC (strapping on his gear eagerly):**  
"Come on, Master! You love training! And I've been waiting all week for this!"

**Mentor (groaning as he slowly gets up from his chair):**  
"I could be at the docks. With my fishing rod. Catching something useful instead of trying to teach combat sense to a boy who has the attention span of a goldfish."

**MC (heading toward the door):**  
"I'll show you I've improved! Three years of training has to count for something!"

**Mentor (following reluctantly, muttering under his breath):**  
"Three years... feels like thirty... why did I agree to train the second-in-command's son... should have stuck to fishing..."

_As they walk toward the training grounds, the MC's excitement is palpable while the mentor trudges along like he's heading to his own execution._

**Mentor (sighing heavily):**  
"Don't be too excited, brat. I'll be going easy on you today, just like always. But remember this - in a real battle, people go all out. If you're even a bit distracted by your own excitement, it will get you killed. You understand me?"

**MC (his enthusiasm dampening slightly):**  
"Yes, Master. I understand."
