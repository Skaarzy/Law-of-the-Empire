**Mentor:**  
"Good. Now let's get this over with so I can get back to more important things. Like my afternoon nap."

_As they reach the training grounds, the mentor kicks at the sand irritably._

**Mentor:**  
"'Just watch over him while I'm gone,' he says. 'Make sure he doesn't get into trouble,' he says. Does he think I'm some kind of nursemaid?"

**MC (trying not to smile):**  
"Well, you do make excellent rice porridge when I'm sick..."

**Mentor (whirling around with an angry glare):**  
"Don't push it, brat! Just because I've kept you alive this long doesn't mean I won't tan your hide right here and now!"

_He moves toward the weapon racks with exaggerated annoyance._

**Mentor:**  
"Now quit your smart mouth and grab your weapons. If I have to be here instead of catching fish, we're going to make the most of it. Time for some real sparring - dodging, parrying, and countering. Let's see if three years of training have made you anything more than a walking target."

## **Naval Build Path (Spear + Chains)**

**Mentor (spinning his practice sword casually):**  
"Spear and chains - our clan's traditional weapons. Let's see if you can actually use them like a warrior instead of getting tangled up like a fishing net."

### **Dodge Training**

**Mentor:**  
"Naval combat is about controlling space and distance. You need to dodge while maintaining your weapon positioning."

_Dodge 4..._

**Mentor:**  
"Too slow! You're moving like you're on a rocking ship, but we're on solid ground! Adjust!"

_Dodge 8..._

**Mentor:**  
"Better! You're starting to move like you understand our clan's fighting philosophy!"

_Dodge 12..._

**Mentor:**  
"At least you know how to not get hit. And you managed not to trip over your own chains. Miraculous."

### **Parry Training**

**Mentor:**  
"The chain adds complexity to every parry. You're not just blocking - you're controlling your opponent's weapon."

_Parry 3..._

**Mentor:**  
"I'm going easy on you, so don't get cocky, brat."

**MC (chain spinning around his spear):**  
"This is going easy? What's going strong then?"

**Mentor (chuckling with pride):**  
"Maybe someday you'll find out. When you can handle our clan's weapons without looking like you're fighting a sea monster."

_Parry 7..._

**Mentor:**  
"Good! You're starting to use the chain as a weapon, not just decoration!"

_Parry 12..._

**Mentor:**  
"Impressive. You're showing real understanding of our traditional techniques. Your ancestors would be... less disappointed."

### **Counter Training**

**Mentor:**  
"The counter is where spear and chain truly shine - bind their weapon and strike simultaneously. Pure clan technique."

_Counter 1..._

**Mentor:**  
"Embarrassing! You had them bound and you still couldn't land a hit! What would your grandfather think?"

_Counter 3..._

**Mentor:**  
"There! That's our clan's true fighting spirit! Bind and strike as one motion!"

_Counter 5..._

**MC (executing a perfect bind-and-counter combination):**  
"Just like grandfather used to do!"

**Mentor (trying to hide his pride):**  
"Just like your grandfather... if he was weak as a newborn sea turtle. You've got the technique, but not the power behind it yet."

**Mentor (wiping sweat from his brow and looking tired):**  
"Enough. I'm too old for this nonsense, and my bones are aching. All this training has made me thirsty."

_He sheathes his practice sword and stretches his back with an audible crack._

**Mentor:**  
"Go to The Iron Carp Bowl and bring me some rice wine. The good stuff, not the swill they serve to the dock workers."

**MC (looking indignant):**  
"What? I'm not your servant, Master! Get your own wine!"

**Mentor (his voice rising to a roar):**  
"I thought you said you know all about combat now! But you can't even handle a simple task like fetching rice wine for your tired old teacher?! You lazy brat!"

**MC (backing away with hands raised):**  
"Alright, alright! I'll get your wine! But I'm not carrying it back if you drink too much and pass out again!"

**Mentor (grumbling as he sits down heavily on a training bench):**  
"Ungrateful whelp... in my day, students showed respect to their elders... mumble mumble... lazy youth these days..."
