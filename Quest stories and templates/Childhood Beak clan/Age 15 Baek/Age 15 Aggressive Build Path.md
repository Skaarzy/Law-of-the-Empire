**Mentor:**  
"Good. Now let's get this over with so I can get back to more important things. Like my afternoon nap."

_As they reach the training grounds, the mentor kicks at the sand irritably._

**Mentor:**  
"'Just watch over him while I'm gone,' he says. 'Make sure he doesn't get into trouble,' he says. Does he think I'm some kind of nursemaid?"

**MC (trying not to smile):**  
"Well, you do make excellent rice porridge when I'm sick..."

**Mentor (whirling around with an angry glare):**  
"Don't push it, brat! Just because I've kept you alive this long doesn't mean I won't tan your hide right here and now!"

_He moves toward the weapon racks with exaggerated annoyance._

**Mentor:**  
"Now quit your smart mouth and grab your weapons. If I have to be here instead of catching fish, we're going to make the most of it. Time for some real sparring - dodging, parrying, and countering. Let's see if three years of training have made you anything more than a walking target."

## **Aggressive Build Path (Twin Harpoons)**

**Mentor (drawing his practice sword):**  
"With those harpoons, you think you're fast and clever. Let's test that theory. Dodging first - try to avoid getting your head knocked off."

### **Dodge Training**

**Mentor:**  
"Speed means nothing if you can't read your opponent's movements. Watch my shoulders, not my blade."

_Dodge 3..._

**Mentor (swinging deliberately slow):**  
"Too slow! A turtle could dodge faster than that! Move those feet!"

_Dodge 7..._

**Mentor:**  
"Better, but you're still telegraphing where you're going to dodge. An enemy will read you like a book!"

_Dodge 12..._

**Mentor (grudgingly):**  
"At least you know how to not get hit. Barely."

### **Parry Training**

**Mentor:**  
"Now let's see if you can actually deflect an attack instead of just running away like a scared fish."

_Parry 2..._

**Mentor:**  
"I'm going easy on you, so don't get cocky, brat."

**MC (breathing hard):**  
"This is going easy? What's going strong then?"

**Mentor (chuckling darkly):**  
"Maybe someday you'll find out. If you live long enough."

_Parry 8..._

**Mentor:**  
"Your rope work is sloppy! You're using the harpoons like clubs instead of precision instruments!"

_Parry 12..._

**Mentor:**  
"Adequate. Your aggressive nature is showing - you're not just deflecting, you're trying to counter-parry. Interesting."

### **Counter Training**

**Mentor:**  
"Now the real test - can you turn defense into offense? Counter-attacking requires perfect timing."

_Counter 1..._

**Mentor:**  
"Pathetic! You had an opening the size of a whale and you missed it completely!"

_Counter 3..._

**Mentor:**  
"There! You see how aggression can work in your favor? Don't hesitate!"

_Counter 5..._

**MC (successfully landing a counter with both harpoons):**  
"I got you!"

**Mentor (smirking):**  
"You got me when I was holding back enough to fight a child. Don't let it go to your head, you're still weak as a newborn seal."

**Mentor (wiping sweat from his brow and looking tired):**  
"Enough. I'm too old for this nonsense, and my bones are aching. All this training has made me thirsty."

_He sheathes his practice sword and stretches his back with an audible crack._

**Mentor:**  
"Go to The Iron Carp Bowl and bring me some rice wine. The good stuff, not the swill they serve to the dock workers."

**MC (looking indignant):**  
"What? I'm not your servant, Master! Get your own wine!"

**Mentor (his voice rising to a roar):**  
"I thought you said you know all about combat now! But you can't even handle a simple task like fetching rice wine for your tired old teacher?! You lazy brat!"

**MC (backing away with hands raised):**  
"Alright, alright! I'll get your wine! But I'm not carrying it back if you drink too much and pass out again!"

**Mentor (grumbling as he sits down heavily on a training bench):**  
"Ungrateful whelp... in my day, students showed respect to their elders... mumble mumble... lazy youth these days..."
