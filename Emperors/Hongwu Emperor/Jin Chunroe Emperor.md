The son of Sinmu, and his firstborn, was not always fond of becoming the next emperor — but he never had a choice. His father was strict and demanded that all his children reach the same level of discipline, training, and strength that he had attained in his youth.
Tae-min was an extroverted young man who loved to party and explore. He often disguised himself and wandered through public taverns and markets, blending in among the common folk. Unlike his other siblings, he had little interest in noble etiquette or their endless demands. He much preferred the company of ordinary people, who were more grounded and sincere.
As he grew older, Tae-min became increasingly curious about the lands across the sea. He was fascinated by the stories and tales — of giant stone castles, of warriors fighting with steel bows while clad in leather, of golden thrones and strange foreign customs. These wonders filled his imagination. He begged his father to let him travel to these places, but Sinmu firmly refused. He believed such a journey would dishonor the imperial name and potentially put Tae-min in danger. To Sinmu, such foreign indulgence was not only useless — it was disrespectful.
Yet Tae-min’s adventurous heart would not be silenced. In secret, he met a foreign merchant who had come from across the sea, a man who told the tales that had long enchanted him. Tae-min paid the merchant handsomely and asked him to return with people from different walks of life — artists, scholars, craftsmen, warriors — promising they would be treated as nobles upon arrival.
The merchant agreed, and after several weeks, returned with ten people aboard his ship. Tae-min helped smuggle them into the Forbidden City. But Sinmu eventually discovered the truth. Furious, he punished Tae-min and banished him from the imperial grounds — forcing him to live among the very foreigners he had brought.
Years passed. Sinmu began to notice that his son was no longer partying or wandering. Instead, he was learning from nobles, working alongside them, and slowly changing. This making in Tae-min more serious behavior softened Sinmu. Eventually, after years of steady growth and quiet dedication, Tae-min proved himself — and was named the next emperor. Not out of favoritism, but because he had taken the burden of his father's legacy upon his own shoulders and sought to correct what Sinmu never could.
When Tae-min became emperor, his reign brought transformation. He gradually introduced new laws and imperial decrees that shifted the empire’s foundation — encouraging the use of guns and steel over swords and spears. Not everyone approved. Some nobles resisted, but they had little choice. The imperial council, many of whom had once served under Sinmu, feared what kind of ruler Tae-min might become.
Of course, not all his laws passed without opposition. Still, his reforms made it easier for foreigners to visit the empire. In truth, Tae-min had been secretly working with those he had once smuggled in. He sold goods from their homelands in the imperial city, started trade routes in secret, and quietly altered the flow of the empire’s economy. Over time, even the locals became intrigued by these foreign ways. Curiosity turned to innovation. The economy grew. The empire expanded.
But nothing lasts forever.
As the empire grew, so too did instability. No one could stop its expansion — but neither could they control it. While the imperial council remained somewhat loyal to the emperor, jealous nobles and ambitious governors began turning against him. They spread lies, stirred unrest, and poisoned public opinion. Even members of the council began to doubt him.
In the end, Tae-min was betrayed and killed by Dong Tak, who led a massive rebellion of the people against the imperial family — ending the reign of the emperor who tried to change too much, too fast.
