Hyeon-sik was quiet as a child and very respectful. Most people often complimented his father, Ryeol, saying that his son would make the perfect next emperor. From an early age, Hyeon was groomed by many within the imperial court to become the heir to the throne. However, his father didn’t agree with this. He believed Hyeon was too fragile for such a role, and that his life would be easier if he simply followed his own path. Ryeol understood too well the stresses of being an emperor and the crushing weight of responsibility it placed on a person.
This confused Hyeon deeply. Whenever the topic of succession came up — when someone mentioned the next emperor and Hyeon in the same sentence — Ryeol would grow cold, become visibly angry, and sternly shut down the conversation. It often seemed as though he didn’t love his son at all.
Despite the overwhelming support Hyeon received from others around him, he came to believe that his father didn’t see him as worthy of being the next emperor — that he was too soft, lacking the qualities Ryeol himself possessed: command, ruthlessness, and the wisdom to act decisively in complex situations. This belief only pushed Hyeon harder. He became fiercely determined to earn his father’s respect and prove himself worthy of the throne.
As he grew older, this obsession consumed him. He became more brutal, more unrelenting — especially as his father continued to assign him to lower-ranking, unimportant positions within the imperial structure. It felt like deliberate sabotage, like Ryeol was discarding him in favor of his brother. Hyeon saw it as rejection. He became convinced that his father had already chosen another son to inherit the empire.
Eventually, Hyeon could no longer contain his frustration. He confronted his father directly — but the confrontation didn’t go as he had planned. To his surprise, Ryeol apologized and appointed Hyeon as his heir. But by then, the damage had already been done.
After all those years of emotional distance and striving in vain, only being named Crown Prince at the age of 35 left Hyeon bitter and cruel. All that time spent trying to impress a father who never once said he believed in him had shaped him into something colder — someone far removed from the quiet, respectful child he once was.

Once Hyeon became emperor, things didn’t change. In his father’s final days, Ryeol had warned Hyeon that things would not be easy from that point on — almost as if he knew his death was near. And in the end, he did. It turned out Ryeol had been hiding the fact that he had a weak heart, something only the imperial physician and the late emperor himself had known.
When Ryeol died quietly in his sleep, Hyeon resented him for keeping that secret — for not even saying a proper goodbye to his family. It enraged Hyeon. He swore to himself he would never become weak like his father. This oath marked the beginning of a harsh, unforgiving rule.
Hyeon’s reign was brutal. He had anyone executed who was even whispered to be corrupt, disloyal, or conspiratorial — and though many were guilty, not all were. His merciless purges made the people resent him, calling him _the Butcher Emperor_. Even during the worst days of the Demon War, the people had still trusted the emperor and believed in the imperial throne. But under Hyeon, things were different.
He was blamed for the empire’s suffering and decline. In a country growing weaker by the year, Hyeon was seen as both cause and curse. And in the end, his father had been right. Hyeon was exploited — deceived and manipulated by corrupt officials who flattered him with kind words while holding knives behind their backs. This betrayal only deepened his paranoia, fueling his obsession with control and power.
Still, Hyeon ruled until the age of 91 — the oldest emperor in the empire’s history. In his final years, his paranoia became law. He passed imperial decrees that many considered immoral and brutal, especially those targeting orthodox sects, pushing the situation to the brink of collapse.
And yet, like his father, Hyeon died quietly in his sleep. But unlike his father, his sons were terrified of him. Hyeon, not wanting to be distant like Ryeol had been to him, went to the opposite extreme — he beat them, controlled them, and forced them to obey. He declared that whoever contributed most to the empire would become the next emperor.
