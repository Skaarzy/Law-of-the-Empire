The Qin emperor was a younger ruler who gained the throne after his father [[the late emperor Zhenlong(震龙)]] died of a sudden heart attack,he became emperor when he was 27 (1348 year)

Made the army of 8000 life-sized terracotta soldiers which he controlled with his mind it was a secret Technic that is past down trough royal blood, he had 5 childern 3 daughters adn 2 sons , the ages where : daughter (43 years old) ,daughter(40 years old), son(38 years old), daughter(32 years old), son (28 years old),

**Soul-Bound Clay Army** Each terracotta statue contains the soul of a warrior who vowed to protect the emperor even in death. These souls are bound into the clay through a combination of the emperor's blood (mixed into the clay during creation) and matching seals - one carved into each statue, one carved into the emperor's flesh.

**Dual-Seal Control System** The blood creates the connection, the seals stabilize the souls and link them to the emperor's consciousness. When he activates the seals, he can command any number of soldiers through pure thought. The matching seal on his flesh allows him to hear their thoughts and feel their death memories.

**Mental Burden** The emperor experiences the final moments and death sensations of every activated soldier simultaneously. Since these warriors were specifically chosen because they felt no pain at death, it's manageable - but hearing 8000 thoughts at once is still an enormous mental strain. He rarely uses the full army because of this overwhelming psychic pressure.

**Seal Degradation** When a statue is damaged or a seal breaks, the soul becomes unstable. It struggles to maintain its form in the clay, creating pain for both the dying soul and the emperor who feels their distress through the connection. Eventually the soul gives up and passes to the afterlife, permanently removing that soldier from the army.

**Selective Activation** The emperor can choose exactly how many soldiers to activate based on what his mind can handle - maybe 50 for a small mission, 500 for a battle, but all 8000 only in the most desperate circumstances when he's willing to risk mental collapse.
