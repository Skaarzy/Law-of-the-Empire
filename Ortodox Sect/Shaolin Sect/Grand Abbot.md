Grand Abbot Myeong-taek (명택) - The Bead of Mercy

Despite his frail appearance—bald head marked with six burn dots, a slender white beard flowing from his chin, and a stooped back—Míngzé moves with effortless calm. He wears a colossal strand of wooden prayer beads that seem far too heavy for his delicate frame, yet he wields them with a strength that defies reason. Always smiling, his presence radiates peace, but when conflict arises, the very beads that symbolize prayer become his shield and his weapon. Known across the empire for his defensive mastery, Míngzé is said to have once stopped a rain of arrows mid-air with a single twirl of his beads. He teaches that true power lies in patience and protection, not destruction.
