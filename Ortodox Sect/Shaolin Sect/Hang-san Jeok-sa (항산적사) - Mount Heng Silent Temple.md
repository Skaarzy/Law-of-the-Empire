**Location Description:**  
Perched high on the snow-capped cliffs of **Mount Heng**, one of the Five Great Sacred Mountains of the Empire, the Silent Temple is shrouded in mist and echoing winds. Accessible only by a winding stair carved into the mountainside, the temple overlooks vast pine forests and deep, hidden valleys below.
The temple grounds are austere and ancientâ€”stone courtyards polished smooth by centuries of barefoot training, wind-bent pines that hum like monks chanting, and great brass bells that toll only during moments of spiritual awakening. Despite its silence, one can always hear the rhythmic thud of fists against wooden posts and the quiet breath of meditation echoing between walls.
Only the most devoted Monks here train under strict discipline, mastering internal and 
external arts, and believe that true strength comes only through harmony between the body
and the spirit. Outsiders are rare, and entrance is permitted only to those deemed worthy by
both the abbot and the mountain itself.
