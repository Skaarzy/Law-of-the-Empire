Under the guidance of the most esteemed monks, he became a master of both internal and external martial arts, mastering the sect’s secret techniques that are passed down only to those who have proven their discipline and resolve. His techniques are often thought to be mystical in nature, allowing him to use inner energy and mind over matter to perform feats that seem impossible. Shaolin’s reputation reached beyond the temple walls, and eventually, the sect was invited to serve as a member of the Censorate an esteemed body that advises the emperor. Jìng Xuán known for his calm demeanor, wisdom, and impartial judgment, Jìng Xuán quickly became a respected figure among the court, offering counsel on matters of justice and imperial governance. Though he is a spiritual leader, so he never actually ordered or made important decisions he only gave advice. Despite his position, Jìng Xuán remains deeply devoted to the Shaolin teachings, often returning to the temple to meditate and train. His role in the Censorate has helped strengthen the connection between the martial sects and the imperial court, and his wisdom and sense of balance make him a highly influential advisor.

Sect hierarchy :
Bodhisattva  
The most revered living figure of the sect — not its founder, but the chosen successor to all secret and ultimate techniques. Selected by the Buddha himself for his unmatched kindness, restraint, and mercy, Bodhisattva is the spiritual embodiment of the sect’s highest ideals. Though he rarely intervenes, all acknowledge him as the strongest cultivator alive, surpassing even the Grand Abbot. 

[[Grand Abbot]]
The highest living authority within the sect, responsible for overseeing all branches and temples. The Grand Abbot interprets sacred texts, guides the sect’s direction, and resolves matters of doctrine or conflict between temples. They are rarely seen and reside in a secluded part of the central monastery.

[[Temple Abbots]]  
The head of an individual temple, responsible for the daily operation, training of disciples, and maintaining harmony within their temple. They answer to the Grand Abbot and ensure their temple follows the sect’s tenets faithfully. Often older and deeply respected, each Temple Abbot may teach unique techniques inherited from their temple’s lineage.

Senior Monk  
A monk who has trained for many years and proven their discipline, skill, and understanding of the sect’s teachings. Senior Monks often mentor younger monks, lead meditation or martial drills, and may be chosen to represent the temple on pilgrimages or councils.

Monk  
The entry-level rank. New initiates who have taken the vows but are still undergoing training and spiritual cultivation. They perform basic duties like cleaning, cooking, copying scriptures, or tending the grounds while learning martial arts, philosophy, and discipline.
