Jeong Hyeon (정현) The Tranquil Monk

Bald-headed and marked with nine solemn dots upon his crown, Jìng Xuán walks in silence, but his presence speaks with divine weight. His face is calm, almost otherworldly in its stillness — serene eyes half-lowered, as if in constant inner dialogue with the universe. Draped in flowing yellow and orange robes too large for his frame, he is weightless yet grounded in immeasurable power.
Trained from childhood in the isolated halls of Mount Heng’s Silent Temple and the place where he witnesed Buddha's Revelation which gave him the tittle of Bodhisattva and made his qi infinite and overpowered, Jìng Xuán is not only a master of martial discipline but also the successor of Bodhisattva a wielder of Qi Manifestation — the rare and nearly unreachable art of shaping one’s inner energy which was infinite into solid form. When he strikes, tangible constructs of golden force burst forth: towering palms, protective shells, or radiant waves that bend the physical world around them.But it is his staff — a weathered monk’s cane adorned with prayer rings — that channels his deepest technique. When planted into the ground, it serves as the anchor for a miraculous feat: the summoning of a colossal Buddha-like manifestation behind him. This divine presence moves as he moves, strikes when he strikes, and radiates a sacred power that overwhelms lesser warriors in body and soul. Before this avatar of enlightenment and force, even seasoned masters are brought to their knees. Jìng Xuán is no passive figure. In combat, he is overwhelming — not through speed or savagery, but through unshakable intent. His palms can shatter stone, his projections can flatten armies, and his calm gaze alone carries the pressure of judgment. Few can mimic his techniques; fewer still can survive them.Some say he is Buddha himself.Also dabbles in gardening and loves to spend his time in his own garden.
