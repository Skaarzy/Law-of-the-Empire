**Name:** Jang Hwan-so  
**Nickname:** The Falling Petal Immortal

An old man with flowing white hair and a long white beard. His layered robes are worn and messy, draping off his shoulders like an old scroll left out in the wind. He walks slowly, often leaning on a crooked wooden cane that seems older than he is, and always carries a calm, amused smile as if he’s gently mocking the world. Despite his frail appearance, there’s a serene, almost divine air to him. When he speaks, his voice feels like the last wind before snow falls.
Weapon None. He abandoned the sword long ago, claiming “the blade grows heavy when one’s heart grows light.” Instead, he uses his cane and precise internal energy to redirect force, slice wind, or even deflect attacks with gestures and sleeves alone.
Fighting Style: His style is purely reactive, like falling petals avoiding the ground—he seems to never attack first, yet always ends the battle. He can disable enemies with one step or redirect a killing strike into silence. Many claim he can erase a person’s intent to fight rather than defeat them physically.
Legacy: Once the strongest Plum Blossom Sword Master, he retired after defeating an enemy said to have cut down entire sects alone. Rather than ruling, he wandered, eventually returning only to train one last disciple—the current Plum Blossom Sword Saint.
