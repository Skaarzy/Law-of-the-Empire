Huang Yaoshi (黄药师)(Plum Blossom Sword Saint)
Became immortal - 1268
Died - unknown
The Plum Blossom Sect draws its strength and philosophy from the plum blossom, a flower that blooms in the harshest winter, symbolizing resilience, purity, and endurance. The sect's martial arts are characterized by fluid, petal-like sword movements that are as beautiful as they are deadly, striking with precision and speed, much like the petals of the plum blossom falling in the wind. Members of the sect believe that, just like the plum blossom, true strength is forged through adversity and patience, emerging only after enduring hardship. The sect teaches that martial mastery is not just about combat but about aligning one's spirit with the quiet elegance and unyielding resolve of the plum blossom, making it a symbol of both beauty and power in the martial world. Their master is The Grand Secretariat of the emperor and a strong martial artist
A solitary master of unmatched elegance, Huang Yaoshi is known across the land as the _Plum Blossom Sword Saint. Once a wandering scholar of medicine and swordsmanship. His sword style mimics the fall of plum blossoms: delicate, unpredictable, and impossible to stop. Every movement seems effortless, yet each strike lands with surgical precision. Though he speaks little, his presence is like a cold wind before a storm—calm, but filled with pressure. Legends say he once defeated ten renowned swordsmen in ten breaths, leaving behind only the scent of blossoms and a single verse carved in stone. Huang Yaoshi is respected as both a healer and a warrior , one who never seeks fame, but whose name is whispered with awe across sects and empires.Its whole aesthetic and culture is more like that of the Japanese with clear rooms with sitting on the floor and mats with have right posture and dressed like in japan men and women the whole region should be using Japans features for everything from houses to inside decor to clothes and how they move
