The **Plum Blossom Sect** is located at the base of the **Dividing Peaks**, but their true treasure lies in the **Eternal Blossom Forest** that spreads across the mountainside. This sacred woodland is the **only place in the world where plum blossom trees still grow**, making it irreplaceably precious.
The sect **protects the forest with all their might**, as it's said that the **Eternal Blossom Forest grants disciples special qi** that allows for **faster cultivation growth and stronger qi development** in general. This makes their territory not just a home, but a vital cultivation resource that gives the sect a significant advantage.
The forest's unique properties explain why the Plum Blossom Sect is so fiercely protective of their domain - losing the Eternal Blossom Forest would mean losing their sect's primary source of power and potentially the last plum blossoms in existence.
