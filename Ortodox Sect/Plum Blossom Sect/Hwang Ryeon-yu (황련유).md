Hwang Ryeon-yu (황련유) - The Jade Spear

Huang Lianyu, the son of Huang Yaoshi, stepped into leadership of the Plum Blossom Sect during his father’s long seclusion. Like his father, he possesses a pale complexion and a striking contrast of dark hair the difference is his piercing pink eyes—an image both calm and intense. Though not as overwhelmingly powerful as his father, Lianyu’s strength lies in his keen intelligence, sharp instincts, and deep understanding of the sect’s traditions.
His weapon of choice is a finely crafted spear, known as the **Jade Dragon Spear**, imbued with the sect’s ancient spiritual energy. Lianyu mastered the **Blossom Spear Technique**, a graceful yet lethal form passed down from the sect’s extensive library—an art that blends swift, flowing strikes with explosive bursts of power, symbolizing the transient beauty and deadly nature of the plum blossom.
While his father was a master of silence and subtlety, Lianyu’s leadership style is more strategic and perceptive, often relying on careful planning and intuitive judgment to overcome challenges. Though he does not inspire fear through raw power, his disciples respect his wisdom and ability to anticipate enemies’ moves, making him a formidable leader in his own right.
