**Family Name**: Li (李)  
**Family Business Name**: **Li Trading Company (李商会)**

Background Explanation:
The **Li family**'s wealth and prominence stem from their **Li Trading Company**. Founded generations ago by Li Huixin’s ancestors, the company began as a small-scale trading operation focusing on local goods, but over the years, it grew into one of the empire's most influential merchant conglomerates. The company is known for its extensive network of trade routes, particularly dealing with **luxurious textiles**, **rare spices**, and **precious metals**, all of which are highly sought after by both the imperial court and foreign dignitaries.
The Li Trading Company operates from various strategically located hubs across the empire, facilitating trade between the capital and distant regions.
They are involved in both **domestic** and **international** trade, dealing with **silk, jade, tea**, and **precious spices** imported from distant lands like the west, north, and southeast.
The family’s wealth comes from both **retail** and **wholesale**, as they have a monopoly on specific goods in key markets across the empire.
**Li Huixin**, as the current **Minister of Revenue**, continues to expand his family’s influence by overseeing not only the empire’s financial policies but also by leveraging his family’s vast network for political and economic advantage. He ensures that trade is steady, taxes are fair, and the empire’s wealth flows smoothly.
His leadership has enabled the **Li Trading Company** to thrive, making them indispensable to the empire’s economy, yet his personal reputation remains untarnished by corruption, a rarity among such wealthy families
