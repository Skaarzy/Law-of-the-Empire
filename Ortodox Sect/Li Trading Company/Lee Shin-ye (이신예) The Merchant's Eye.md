Lee Shin-ye (이신예) The Merchant's Eye

Li Shenrui, the son of Li Huixin, inherited more than just his father’s name and position—he carries the legacy of the Li Trading Company with sharp instincts and a natural gift for reading people and deals. Though still young by court standards, Shenrui has earned the rare respect of both seasoned ministers and grizzled merchants. His nickname, _The Merchant’s Eye_, comes from his uncanny ability to sense whether a trade, alliance, or negotiation will succeed or collapse—sometimes before a single word is spoken.

His martial arts training, though not aggressive or deadly, is elegant and defensive. He’s skilled at redirecting force, deflecting danger, and escaping from danger rather than meeting it head-on. Much like in business, he believes the best victories come from redirection, not brute strength.

His power of _instincting_—an intuitive sense that allows him to feel the weight and potential of a deal or the nature of a person—has become his greatest asset. With it, he has exposed scams, predicted market shifts, and even averted diplomatic crises. Unlike his father’s smooth, silver-tongued approach, Shenrui often speaks only when he needs to, preferring to let others reveal themselves first.

Despite his youth, the emperor appointed him as Minister of Revenue, impressed by his results and the quiet precision with which he handles the empire’s economy. Some whisper that he is even sharper than his father was at that age—a rumor Shenrui neither confirms nor denies. His presence at court is a symbol of the new generation: respectful of tradition, but unafraid to carve a new path.
