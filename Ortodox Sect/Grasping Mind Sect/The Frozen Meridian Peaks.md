Summit of Inner Enlightenment (the fortress at the peak)
Halls of Frostbound Meridians (the massive cave system)

The fortress at the peak is the made on top of the highest peak in the whole world most people visit it because it is said that one can see the celestial plane and there are even rumors about deities vising this peak just so they can see what humans are like and a lot of masters gain powerful knowledge on this peak , its also the place where the master of grasping mind sect cultivates and teaches his higher disciples about qi, dao and techniques of the grasping mind sect its the place where on can learn the highest knowledge about dao and qi , the cave on the other hand is as important because without them normal people would be able to reach that fortress on top of the peak, its also the place where the grasping mind sect disciples live thrive and train . its the caves are highly detailed and luxurious u would say the are caves more like grand halls of the empire.

**THE FROZEN MERIDIAN MOUNTAINS & GRASPING MIND SECT**
The **Grasping Mind Sect** commands the **Frozen Meridian Mountains**, a brutal range of snow-covered peaks where only the most dedicated cultivators can survive. Their stronghold is split between two legendary locations: the **Summit of Inner Enlightenment** and the **Halls of Frostbound Meridians**
The **Summit of Inner Enlightenment** sits atop the **highest peak in the entire world**, where the air is so thin that only inner disciples and above can breathe without cultivation techniques. This sacred fortress is renowned as the place where one can supposedly see into the **Celestial Plane** itself, and rumors persist that **deities visit this peak** to observe humanity. Here, the sect master cultivates and teaches the deepest mysteries of dao and qi to his most advanced disciples, making it the ultimate destination for cultivation knowledge.
The **Halls of Frostbound Meridians** serve as both the sect's primary residence and the main route to the summit. These massive cave systems are partially open - traders, beggars, and common folk can shelter in the lower levels, but only inner disciples know the secret passages that lead upward through the labyrinthine network. The caves act as a natural filter: visitors can enter the bottom, but without knowledge of the true paths, they can never reach the sacred peak above.
This creates a perfect symbiosis - the sect maintains contact with the outside world through the lower caves while keeping their most sacred training grounds completely secure. The mountain's brutal environment does the rest, ensuring only the truly worthy can ascend to where mortals glimpse the divine.
