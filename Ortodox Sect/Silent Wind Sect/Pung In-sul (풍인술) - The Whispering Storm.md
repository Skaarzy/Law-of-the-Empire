Pung In-sul (풍인술) - The Whispering Storm
Became Immortal: 1305
Died: 1374(or other year but must be killed in a battlefield or a fight against the heavenly demon)


Pung In-sul, the second master of the Silent Wind Sect, was a slim and agile man whose movements were poetry in motion—graceful, quick, and unpredictable. Though extroverted and open-hearted among friends and disciples, he was silent and merciless in battle. His calm demeanor and sharp mind made him both a beloved teacher and a feared enemy.
Under his guidance, the Silent Wind Sect reached new heights, gaining widespread recognition for its mastery of air-based martial arts and mobility. Pung In-sul expanded the sect’s philosophy and training, blending traditional techniques with new ones, and personally trained many of the empire’s greatest warriors. During the Eternal War, he played a key role in high-risk missions and battlefield disruption. His signature weapon was a **rope dart**—a small, curved dagger attached to a long, lightweight chain or silk rope. With it, Pung In-sul could attack from impossible angles, entangle weapons, disarm opponents, and even swing himself across terrain. In his hands, the rope dart moved like a living thing, coiling and snapping through the air with deadly precision. He combined this with secondary use of **flying daggers**, small aerodynamic blades he could manipulate with controlled bursts of wind to harass or finish distant targets. His fighting style was a blur of motion—twisting, leaping, spinning—using the environment to his advantage and the wind to mask his movements. In combat, he never stayed in one place for long. The rope dart flickered like lightning, striking vital points and retreating just as fast, while the flying daggers darted through the air with razor precision. Few lived to see him twice.
Even after his death, Pung In-sul’s techniques and reforms remained the foundation of the Silent Wind Sect. His legend lives on in stories, murals, and the echo of wind through the training halls—forever remembered as _The Whispering Storm_.
