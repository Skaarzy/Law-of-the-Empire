**Background**:  
Zhou Weiguo comes from an unremarkable, humble family. His lineage is not renowned for wealth or fame, but rather for their deep-rooted respect for discipline and duty. His father, a minor officer in the army, instilled in him a strong sense of honor and responsibility from an early age. Zhou grew up in a small town, practicing his martial skills and studying the art of war under the guidance of his mentor, an experienced general who recognized Zhou's potential early on.
Though his family is not famous, his military career speaks for itself. Through years of service, Zhou climbed the ranks, not due to extraordinary abilities or luck, but because of his iron discipline, strategic mind, and fair leadership. His rise was earned through skill, loyalty, and his ability to inspire respect from soldiers and officials alike.
**Personality**:  
Zhou is cold and stern, often maintaining a serious demeanor that can appear intimidating to others. He is not one for unnecessary pleasantries and speaks with precision and authority. However, beneath his stern exterior lies a deeply fair and just individual. He values the well-being of his men and is known for making calculated decisions that put the safety and strategic success of the army above all else. His fairness has earned him respect, even from those who feared his imposing presence.
Though he doesn’t possess any supernatural abilities or rare combat techniques, Zhou’s true strength lies in his ability to command. His soldiers follow him not out of fear, but out of respect for his competence and sense of fairness. His strategic mind and ability to read the battlefield are unmatched, and his decisions often turn the tide of battle. Zhou is a master tactician who excels in long-term strategies and resource management, often winning wars not through brute strength but through cunning, patience, and preparation.
**Appearance**:  
Zhou Weiguo is a tall and imposing figure, with a military demeanor that is both professional and unyielding. His face is often set in a stern expression, his eyes cold and focused, always scanning the situation around him. His attire is simple, but well-maintained—he wears the uniform of a high-ranking general, with a few personal touches like his mentor’s seal on his shoulder. His posture is always straight, and he carries himself with an aura of authority.He uses most  weapon but his favorite is a bow and arrow and a guandao
**Family**:  
Zhou is married to a woman from a respected family of scholars, and they have a child who is being raised to carry on the family's legacy. Despite his cold nature, Zhou cares deeply for his family and ensures they are well-provided for, though he spends little time with them due to his military duties. His wife is supportive of his work but often wishes he would find time to be more present at home.
