After the eternal war a first marital council was made just for the ruling of what to do with the heavenly demon who didn't surrender himself but his location is know and he isn't hiding , the then first marital council wasn't named or know it would resurface but more of a one time thing where as the situation was dire , all of the surviving sect master and elder together with the 5 clan head and the imperial court came to one place the place where it all began at the now rebuilt but a part left intentionally burnt so its never forgotten and the grave that is place next to it of The falling petal immortal the plum blossom retreat, it had only one agenda what to do with the heavenly demon the imperial court voted to kill him and burn him at stake the clans some agreed with the empire some said its unnecessary to kill him as its was the empire that caused his creation , and the majority which was the sects most with a few who supported the empire agreed on imprisonment and so it was decide that every sect would chose 2 of their best and most powerful to go defeat and subdue the heavenly demon, and so it happened with the heavenly demon putting little resistance but still laughing and enjoying the fighting was subdued with most of the sect masters and warriors thinking he could have killed them all if he wanted but nonetheless he gave up and was chained and put inside his very throne room he once gave orders from now kneeling and visibly weakened he is given daily blood rations  just enough to survive but not enough to regain any power at all the once heavenly demon now is a simple human with no qi in his blood (A man dying of thirst getting just one drop of water daily is what the sects masters told him) .And is still being guarded by hundreds of the plum blossom warriors  who let only certain high-ranking sect members or people who have been approved are allowed to visit him.After his imprisonment the martial court was disbanded as the divide between the sects and the empire grew wider to the point of the sects separation.
Years and years after a new council was made by the sects with the same name and a similar purpose but this time it was only the sect elders and leaders that where in it and it served as a stepping stone for the sects to unite and give each other guidance and any type of aid necessary as the separation from the empire and the clans took a toll on the sects economy the aftermath of the demon war was wearing the sects out over time, the location this time is discrete yet calm a small hut in the coast town of the heavenly sword sect province and only those who attend know its location as its a house of a simple resident of that town who lends it to the sect as a simple resort for ordinary warriors once a year while they travel ,which is a cover as those warriors then clean and prepare the house as well as scout for any weird stuff happening only after all that is the marital council date set
