The Divine Celestial Seal Sect is a highly secretive and respected sect within the empire, dedicated to sealing and banishing demons that threaten the land. Their primary goal is to protect the empire from the demonic forces that lurk in the shadows, using mystical techniques and divine powers passed down through generations. The sect has its roots in ancient spiritual practices, combining elements of divination, magic, and martial arts to combat dark forces. Members of the sect are known for their expertise in crafting powerful sealing scrolls, often using ancient texts and symbols to bind and neutralize evil spirits.The sect is led by the Grand Exorcist, a figure of immense power and influence, who holds the sacred responsibility of guiding the emperor through times of demonic crisis. The leader of the sect is not just a spiritual advisor but also a protector of the empire, using their knowledge to stop demonic uprisings, seal away dark forces, and ensure the safety of the realm. The Grand Exorcist is often seen as a bridge between the mortal world and the spiritual realm, holding the knowledge of the ancient arts and possessing the power to communicate with forces beyond human comprehension. Their leader is always a person of deep spiritual discipline, even got blind as a result of his intense connection to the mystical world. Despite his blindness, they possess extraordinary abilities to sense and perceive things others cannot, particularly in relation to demonic forces. He is known to wield demon sealing papers, which are enchanted with symbols that can banish or bind evil spirits. These papers are considered incredibly powerful and are used by the leader with telepathic abilities to protect the empire from the growing threat of dark forces. In terms of his interaction with the emperor, the leader is the only person who can speak directly with the ruler regarding matters of the supernatural. His words are often cryptic and filled with profound meaning, and the emperor relies on his guidance to make important decisions concerning the fate of the empire. His silence is considered an important aspect of their power, as it symbolizes their deep connection to the spiritual world. When he does speak, his words are seen as divine prophecy, offering warnings or advice on matters of grave importance. The sect’s influence is far-reaching, and they operate in the background, unseen by the public eye. Their members are highly trained in the arts of exorcism, sealing, and spiritual warfare, and they are called upon only in times of great need. The sect is also known for its strict discipline and adherence to its ancient traditions, often isolating itself from the politics of the empire in order to focus on its sacred duties. The Grand Exorcist and his followers are often viewed with a mix of reverence and fear, as their power is unmatched when it comes to dealing with demonic forces. Their role in the empire is crucial, and they are considered the last line of defense against the supernatural dangers that threaten to tear the realm apart.
