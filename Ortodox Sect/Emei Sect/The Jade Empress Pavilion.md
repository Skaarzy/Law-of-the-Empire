 The **Emei Sect** controls a region of rolling hills, forests, and grassy flatlands - a gentler terrain compared to the harsh mountains of other sects. This all-female sect holds a unique position in the cultivation world, treated more like **royalty than typical sect members**.
Their stronghold, **The Jade Empress Pavilion**, sits majestically on the shoreline and is unlike any other sect headquarters. Rather than a simple pavilion or monastery, it resembles a **grand imperial city** - a testament to the Emei Sect's elevated status in the world. The complex is **strictly forbidden to men**, maintaining the sect's exclusive feminine sanctuary.
The Jade Empress Pavilion's imperial architecture and shoreline location reflect both the sect's royal treatment and their refined, elegant approach to cultivation - far removed from the harsh, survival-focused strongholds of the mountain sects.
