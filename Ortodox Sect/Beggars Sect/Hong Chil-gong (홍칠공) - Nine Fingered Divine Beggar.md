To the common folk,Hong Qigong is nothing more than a filthy, limping beggar with a missing finger and a love for greasy food. He wanders marketplaces with a crooked smile and a patched-up robe, easily dismissed by nobles and guards alike. But behind this harmless facade lies the true Chief of the Beggar Sect, a hidden giant in the shadows of the empire.Some say the sect's leader, **Hong Qigong**, a master of the sect’s most unpredictable martial arts, lost his finger in a duel with a demon. Others claim he sacrificed it as penance for a moment of reckless rage. However, no one truly knows the truth behind the loss of his finger, just as they know little of the man himself. Despite his humble appearance, Hong Qigong is a direct advisor to the emperor, serving as a member of the imperial Censorate. His position allows him to speak the truths no one else dares to voice, making him a ghost in the empire’s political landscape. Hong Qigong’s legend continues to grow, as does the reach of his beggars. he remains a shadow, guiding his people and his network from the deepest corners of the empire. Those who cross him, or the people he serves, learn too late that they have underestimated the true power of the Beggar Sect.
