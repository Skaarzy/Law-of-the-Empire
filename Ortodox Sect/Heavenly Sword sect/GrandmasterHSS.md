Both were inner disciples of the same time and both had the same master yet they became each others opposite.


**Grandmaster Won Dae-gi (원대기) - Wandering AshAsh"**
- An old man with dirt-caked robes, wild matted hair, and a beard that looks like it hasn’t been combed in decades.
- Blind, with a long scar stretching across left eye. Despite this, he walks with sure footing and rarely stumbles.
- Carries a rusted, absurdly long katana that looks like it was pulled from a grave—but it's said he could use a twig and still defeat a master.
- Lives more like a drifter than a Grandmaster, roaming the mountains and villages, often visiting sect branches unannounced.
- Known for laughter, strange stories, and meddling in mundane affairs for his own amusement.
- Many disciples meet him without realizing who he is until he vanishes, leaving only cryptic advice behind.
- Extroverted, unpredictable, and wise in an unorthodox way—his presence is chaotic, but his insights always hit the mark.
