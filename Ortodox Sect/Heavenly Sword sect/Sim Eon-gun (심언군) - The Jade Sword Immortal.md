**Sim Eon-gun (심언군) - The Jade Sword Immortal"**
- Immaculately dressed in flowing, colorful robes stitched with rare silk, adorned with sect insignia.
- His white beard is always trimmed to a perfect line, and his hair neatly combed and oiled.
- Wields no sword—instead, he walks with a refined black cane and carries a lacquered parasol, not for need, but for appearance.
- A deeply introverted figure, rarely seen outside the sect’s ancestral halls or ceremonial chambers.
- Master of political maneuvering and internal doctrine.
- Known for speaking little but decisively—his words can change sect law, and his counsel is often the final voice before any major decision.
- Seen as the living standard of tradition and formality—where Yuan Daqi is the fire, Shen Yanjun is the water.
