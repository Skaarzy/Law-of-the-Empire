The Celestial Blade Fortress
The Celestial Blade fortress is nestled at the foot of Cheon Geom-san. At the base of the mountain, a deep, jagged **crack** runs wide and dark—a natural fissure said to have been carved by a sword strike so powerful it split the mountain’s foundation.At the top there are some cracks that look like slashes made by swords it is said that is where the elders and grand-masters train and perfect their technique.The crack at the bottom serves as the **hidden entrance** to an extensive network of ancient **sect caves and training grounds** beneath the mountain. Only those trusted by the Heavenly Sword Sect may enter, accessing sacred chambers where masters refine their skills and protect treasured relics. The city spreads across the lower slopes and valley around Mount Cheon gemon-san, fortified by sturdy walls and natural cliffs. It is the sect’s bustling capital, home to grand halls, training fields, marketplaces, and the residences of disciples and elders.Most think that the slash is a simple thing that someone just happened to do and create it as a vault of sorts but only those who entire know why that slash was so impossible to make its because the mountain itself is made out of a big vein of Rhenium that goes from the peak to the bottom of the mountain which would make the mountain impossible to slash because that ore is one of the strongest and most dense with a high melting point so only a grand-master or some say even a deity can could have done it , now that same ore is use to craft sword for only the few special people because its so valuable and hard to mine only the grand-master can decide when it is worth making a weapon out of it, and the weapons become godly and can only be made there in those caves by blacksmiths who perfected only making swords .
The crack in the mountain stands as a silent testament to the sect’s legendary origins—a symbol of the power and legacy held within the celestial blade fortress.


The **Celestial Blade Fortress** is nestled at the foot of **Cheon Geom-san (천검산)**, where a deep, jagged crack runs wide and dark at the mountain's base—a natural fissure said to have been carved by a sword strike so powerful it split the mountain's foundation. At the peak, smaller cracks resembling sword slashes mark where **elders and grand-masters train and perfect their techniques**.

The crack at the bottom serves as the **hidden entrance** to an extensive network of ancient **sect caves and training grounds** beneath the mountain. Only those trusted by the Heavenly Sword Sect may enter these sacred chambers where masters refine their skills and protect treasured relics. The city spreads across the lower slopes and valley, fortified by sturdy walls and natural cliffs—a bustling capital with grand halls, training fields, marketplaces, and residences.

Most believe the slash is simply a convenient vault, but only those who enter know the truth: the entire mountain is **one massive vein of Rhenium** running from peak to base. This makes the slash impossible to explain—Rhenium is one of the **strongest, densest metals with an extremely high melting point**. Only a **grand-master or deity** could have achieved such a feat.

This same precious ore crafts swords for only the most special individuals. So valuable and difficult to mine, only **grand-masters decide when it's worth forging**. The weapons become **godly artifacts**, crafted exclusively in those caves by blacksmiths who have perfected the art of Rhenium sword-making.

The crack stands as a silent testament to the sect's legendary origins—a symbol of unimaginable power within the Celestial Blade Fortress.
