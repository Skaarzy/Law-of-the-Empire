**External Pillar – Elder Ha Yu (하유) - Ringshadow"**

- Mysterious but friendly, always wearing a **bamboo straw hat (斗笠)** and light armor.
    
- Carries a **ring-pommel saber (环首刀)**—slightly curved, its flat tip and dangling metal rings chime faintly as he moves.
    
- Soft-spoken, composed, and deeply observant. Smiles often but reveals little.
    
- Manages the sect’s diplomacy, alliances, and intelligence networks.
    
- Known to appear in distant regions with news before scouts arrive. Many underestimate him—once.
