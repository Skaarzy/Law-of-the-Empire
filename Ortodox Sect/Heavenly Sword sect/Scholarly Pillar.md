**Scholarly Pillar –Elder Mun Do-heo (문도허) - Drunken Scholar"**

- An older man with wild, unkempt black hair but a clean, neat beard.
    
- Dresses in layered, comfortable robes, with a thick **kāṣāya-like** wrap around his waist.
    
- A **calabash gourd** (葫芦) hangs at his side—usually filled with wine, tea, or unknown liquids.
    
- His self-made sword is short, thick, with a squared wooden hilt and a flat tip—ugly but brutally efficient.
    
- Extroverted, sloppy, and carefree, often found napping in libraries or lecturing drunk under a tree.
    
- A genius of strange philosophies and forgotten sword theories.
