**1. Martial Pillar – Elder Gwan Cheol (관철) - Thunderblade Iron"**

- A towering, heavily muscled old man with a long, thin white beard flowing down his chest.
    
- Wields a massive, single-edged curved sword, wide and heavy near the tip—made for cleaving, not finesse.
    
- Loud, aggressive, and intense. Speaks like thunder and trains disciples with ferocity.
    
- Visibly aged, his strength is terrifying—he’s broken swords by parrying barehanded.
    
- Famous for charging into fights before orders are given, yet unmatched in loyalty to the sect.
