**Internal Pillar – Elder Mok Seong (목성) - Steel Judge"**

- Middle-aged, clad in ceremonial armor with a **forehead ribbon (额带)** and a **hairpin (簪子)** securing his topknot.
    
- Carries a massive, thick straight sword with no ornament—pure function and power.
    
- Cold, stern, and silent, often mistaken for being angry—but he's simply focused.
    
- Enforces rules, oversees sect discipline, and judges internal disputes with ruthless fairness.
    
- Believes truth is more important than comfort—when he speaks, it’s always honest and heavy.
