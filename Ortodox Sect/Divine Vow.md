No orthodox or unorthodox sect shall engage in open war with one another without just cause and Imperial arbitration.

No sect may absorb, dissolve, or forcibly merge with another sect through coercion, marriage, or manipulation under the guise of alliance or shared power.

**4. No disciple is above the vow**
