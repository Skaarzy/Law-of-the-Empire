Lei Tianba is the living embodiment of a storm—towering, broad-shouldered, and forged from raw power. His immense physique is not only a testament to his strength but also a canvas marked by the heavens themselves. Across his arms, chest, and shoulders spread **branching lines of light**, resembling **lightning veins** or the twisting limbs of ancient trees. These glowing marks shimmer faintly at rest, but during battle, they ignite—surging with electric fury, arcing over his skin like living thunder.
His long white beard and flowing hair ripple like storm clouds caught in a high wind, and his piercing blue eyes flash with the cold clarity of a lightning strike. Few dare meet his gaze for long—it is like staring into the heart of a storm.
He wields a massive **guandao**, forged beneath the sky’s fury and etched with runes that crackle when drawn. When he swings it, thunder claps follow, and few things—walls, armies, or mountains—can stand against it. It is more than a weapon; it is a thunderbolt in his hands.Whenever he strikes with it a sound of thunder is heard across the battlefield
 As the master of **Divine Thunder Hall**, he reshaped the sect into a living storm. His disciples train like soldiers and strike in perfect unison, mimicking the sudden and devastating force of a thunderclap.As **Grand Secretariat to the Emperor**, his authority is second only to the throne. His words are law. His will is enforced like lightning—immediate, merciless, and absolute.
Wherever Lei Tianba walks, the skies darken and the wind stiffens. And when he fights, the glowing branches of thunder on his body burst to life, casting shadows like cracks in the sky.
**He does not bring the storm—he is the storm.**
