Heart of the Storm Hall

Its the rugged mountains that are located above the empire and protect it from other part of the world but are also not inhabitable because the rugged terrain make the metals like iron peak out of the ground which attracts massive storms which can last for months at a time , there is a location that is somewhat of protected from the storms its on the lower part of the mountains it was took long to build because first the are must have been cleaned of the metals and ore and only then could the stronghold be built, even though the mountains contain a lot of ore and metals only some miner in organized trips go onto the mountain to mine and its so dangerous that sometimes they don't come back.The reason the divine thunder hall is located here is because its leader No Cheon-pa was a great general and had a massive part in eternal war so he was give the hall to protect the empire and keep other in place so they don't even try to  invade the empire.

The **Divine Thunder Hall** commands the **Rugged Mountains**, a treacherous range that serves as the empire's natural fortress wall against the outside world. These jagged peaks are uninhabitable death traps where exposed veins of iron and other metals jutting from the rocky terrain constantly attract **massive storms that can rage for months at a time**. The mountains' wealth of ore comes at a deadly price - only the most organized mining expeditions dare venture into the peaks, and many never return.
The **Heart of the Storm Hall** sits in a carefully chosen location on the **lower slopes** - one of the few areas with some protection from the endless tempests. Building this stronghold was an monumental undertaking that required **completely clearing all metal and ore from the construction site** before any building could begin, a process that took years of dangerous work.
**No Cheon-pa**, the hall's leader and former great general, earned this position through his crucial role in the **Eternal War**. The empire granted him command of this strategic location not just as a reward, but as a vital military posting. The Divine Thunder Hall serves dual purposes: **protecting the empire's northern border** and acting as a deterrent force so formidable that potential invaders abandon any thoughts of attack before they begin.
The constant storms make the mountains nearly impassable, while the hall's presence ensures that anyone foolish enough to attempt invasion faces both nature's fury and the empire's most battle-tested warriors.
