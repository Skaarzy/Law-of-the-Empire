In these novels, characters often try to gain insights into the Dao, which can give them supernatural powers or even control over aspects of the natural world.

**[Yin & Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang)** (阴阳 yīnyáng) – the duality present in all aspects of the universe. For instance: **Yin** is Female / Soft / Death / Dark / the Moon, while **Yang** is Male / Hard / Life / Light / the Sun – the comparisons are endless. Yin & Yang describe how opposite or contrary forces are actually complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world, and how they mutually give rise to each other.

- **Wulin/Murim** (武林 무림) – literally “Martial Forest”, figuratively refers to the “community of martial artists” within the Jianghu. The Wulin is typically controlled by an alliance formed by the Righteous/Orthodox sects in order to uphold justice. Note. somtimes these novels and manhwa are wrongly classified as murim when in reality the genre of these novels is wuxia. Wulin/murim is setting where the story takes place.

Seen as champions of the common people. _Similar to the romanticized European [Knights-errant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight-errant), but without any of the feudal overtones._

**Cultivation Method** (功法 gōngfǎ) (心法 xīnfǎ) – a mystical art or collection of techniques which cultivators practice in order to cultivate.  _Related: [Qigong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qigong) (气功)_

**Manual** (秘笈 mìjí) – a book containing detailed instructions on training in a cultivation method or martial arts style. Usually regarded as extremely valuable and thus kept secret (or at least, not made publicly available).

- **Sutras & Scriptures** (经 jīng) – sacred writings. In the context of these novels, they typically pertain to cultivation or martial arts. Used more or less interchangeably with “Manual”.

**[Dantian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dantian)** (丹田 dāntián) – literally translates as “[Cinnabar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_alchemy#Process_and_purpose) Field” or “Elixir Field”. Refers to the region in the body where a person’s [Qi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi) is concentrated. There are technically three dantians, but these novels simplify the concept and only use the lower dantian (located three finger widths below and two finger widths behind the navel).

**[Meridians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_%28Chinese_medicine%29)** (经脉 jīngmài) – the network of vessels/channels in the body through which Qi flows. Like [blood vessels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel), but for Qi instead of blood.

**Qi Circulation** (行气 xíngqì) – the act of controlling Qi to flow from the dantian, through the meridians, and back into the dantian in a cycle. The purpose of this varies between novels, but usually it helps replenish stamina, purify the Qi, or strengthen the meridians.

**Breathing Exercises** (吐纳 tùnà) – also known as Tu Na Breathing. A special way of breathing which expels the turbid Qi within the body and draws in the Qi of the natural world. An essential part of cultivation.

- **Embryonic Breathing** (胎息 tāixī) – also known as Taixi or Fetal Breathing. A form of breathing without using one’s nose and mouth. Instead, the practitioner might breathe through their pores or dantian (for example).

Often compared to how babies breathe in the womb (through the umbilical cord).

**[Meditation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation)** (冥想 míngxiǎng) – a practice for training or calming the mind and spirit. Cultivators spend a great deal of time in meditation, as both the cultivation of Qi and contemplation of Insights generally require it.

- **Closed Door Training** (闭关 bìguān) – also called Closed Door Meditation or Closed Door Cultivation. Training done in seclusion, usually to focus on breaking through a bottleneck or to avoid becoming distracted at a crucial moment and suffering a backlash as a result.

**Insight** (参悟 cānwù) (顿悟 dùnwù) – related to [enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_%28spiritual%29). Cultivators usually gain insights by meditating, engaging in life-or-death battles, or going out into the world to experience new things. These insights are often needed in order to master techniques or advance to higher stages of cultivation.

**Internal Demons** (心魔 xīnmó) – literally translates as “Heart Devils”. Rather than standard demons or devils, these are a practitioner’s negative emotions and other mental barriers which hinder their training/cultivation. Internal Demons, in some cases, can even attack the practitioner from the inside, and failure to adequately resist them may result in Qi Deviation.

**Qi Deviation** (走火入魔 zǒuhuǒ rùmó) – also known as [Qigong Deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zou_huo_ru_mo). Literally translates as “to catch fire and be entered [possessed] by devils”. A state wherein the cultivation base becomes dangerously unstable, causing internal damage to the body and symptoms of psychosis. People who succumb to their Internal Demons, who practice cultivation/martial arts incorrectly, or who rashly use forbidden arts are all at risk of falling into this state.

**Bottleneck** (瓶颈 píngjǐng) – the term for when cultivators figuratively hit a wall in their training and it suddenly becomes incredibly difficult to proceed. When they reach a bottleneck, cultivators may require new Insights, the aid of medicinal pills, or even harsher training in order to make a **Breakthrough** (突破 tūpò) and successfully bypass the bottleneck.

**Impurities** (杂质 zázhì) – usually described as a smelly, black substance which is secreted from a cultivator’s skin when they reach new cultivation stages or consume special medicinal pills. The result of the body purifying itself and expelling the waste.

# Realm

**Realm** (境地 경지) (境界 경계) – A concept that expresses the skills or achievements of a martial artist in the wuxia novels.

**Third Rate** (三流) – The lowest level

**Second Rate** (二流) – better than third-rate

**First Rate** (一流) –  It is a state on the verge of crossing the wall to peak. In some novels can youse sword qi.

**Peak** (絕頂 절정) – first stage where one is considered to be a Master (高手). Can Freely use Sword Qi

**Transcendence** (超絕頂 초절정) – literally "surpass peak", It is considered to be the limit of a Moorim master with general talent, and he has mastered both sword qi and sword silk , and in some cases, he can use the next step, Sword Aura , even slightly.

The following three realms after Transcendence first appeared in Mookhyang 

**Transcendent Realm** (化境) - one of the hardest terms to translate. In Chinese wuxia basically means someone who's martial arts has reached an extremely high level. But, in Mookhyang was abbreviation for 造化境 lit. Nature/Creation Realm. Earlier translated as **Unrestrained Realm.**

**Profound Realm** (玄境) - Usually at this level you have completely mastered Sword Aura. Originally only a few people could reach this realm in the entire Murim, but because of power escalation most modern novel include many people at this level.

**Life and Death Realm** (生死境) - transcending life and death. Basically impossible to reach except for the mc.

[**Sword Qi**](http://i.imgur.com/IBeuEWm.png) (剑气 jianqi) – A dazzling, powerful energy attack released from the edge of a blade. Forming Swordlight generally requires a profound cultivation base and a deep mastery of swordsmanship.

**Sword Silk** (剑丝) - is the next step of Sword Qi, and refers to the stage in which the sword is tangible like a thread and wrapped around the weapon. However in because. of simplifcation in moden novels, often time it will skip to the next stage.

**Sword Aura** (剑罡) - another hard term to translated with no english equivalent, basically stronger sword qi or reinforced sword qi. The sword qi usually radiates to the same level as the arrow in a way that the naked eye cannot tell. This kind of sword qi condenses into lumps, and the tangible form distinguished by the naked eye is called sword qi into aura, abbreviated as sword aura, and it is emitted in the form of crescent moon or straight line light according to martial arts. If the sword qi is condensed on the object through various media, then Jian Gang can think that the sword qi is a sharper and stronger form.

- **[Staff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_%28staff%29)** (棍 gùn) – a staff made from wood or iron.

**Hidden Weapons** (暗器 ànqì) – weapons that are concealed in some way (often hidden in the owner’s clothing). Their use and effectiveness relies heavily on the element of surprise. Poisoned projectiles (darts/needles/etc) are an especially popular type of hidden weapon.

# Miscellaneous Terms  

**[Eight Trigrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagua)** (八卦 bāguà) – often left untranslated as the “Bagua”. Thought to represent the fundamental principles of reality. In real life, it’s used in fortune-telling. In these novels, it’s mainly only mentioned in passing. For example, a battle formation or martial arts move might have the “Eight Trigrams” in its name

**[Feng Shui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feng_shui)** (风水 fēngshuǐ) – literally translates as “Wind Water”. A form of traditional Chinese divination/fortune-telling, often performed using the Eight Trigrams and a [Feng Shui compass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luopan) (罗盘 luópán). In these novels, it’s mainly only mentioned in passing.

**Formations** (阵 zhèn) (阵法 zhènfǎ) – divided into battle formations and spell formations, although they are often just called “formations”. _Battle formations_ are “fantasy-fied” [tactical formations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_formation) used by several cultivators or martial artists attacking in concert. _Spell formations_ are also called Arrays. They’re essentially magic circles which cast a continuous area-of-effect spell on the location the formation encompasses.

- **Formation Flags** (阵旗 zhènqí) – magical flags set up at key points in order to activate a spell formation (usually around the perimeter).
- **Restrictions** (禁制 jìnzhì) (禁法 jìnfǎ) – also translated as Seals, Restrictive Spells, or Spell Restrictions. Somewhat similar to formations. They are spells which form a barrier around a location or act to seal/suppress a person or object.

**Essence** (精 jīng) – often called **Blood Essence** (精血). It’s basically “lifeblood” or “life force”. Powerful techniques sometimes require cultivators to expend their Essence, shortening their lifespan as a result.

- Essence is one of the [Three Treasures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Treasures_%28traditional_Chinese_medicine%29) of [Internal Alchemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neidan).

**[Robes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanfu)** (袍 páo) – the characters in these novels usually wear [robes](http://i.imgur.com/UhbovYz.png), as was the norm in ancient China. Cultivators are often said to wear [Scholar / Daoist robes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daopao) (道袍). Martial artists are frequently depicted wearing [Tang suits](http://i.imgur.com/aLDH4jw.png) (唐装).

**[Face](http://chineseculture.about.com/od/businesseconomy/fl/Face-Culture-in-China.htm)** (面子 miànzi) – a person’s reputation in society and amongst their peers. If someone “has face” (有面子), they have a good reputation. If they “have no face” (没面子), then they have a bad reputation. “Giving face” (给面子) to someone means to defer to or pay homage to them. “Losing face” (丢脸) means that a person has hurt their reputation. “Not wanting face” (不要脸) means that a person is acting shamelessly, in a way that suggests they don’t care about hurting their reputation.

**[Kowtow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowtow)** (叩头 kòutóu) – an act of deep respect shown by [prostration](http://i.imgur.com/jOSaMiA.jpg). The highest sign of reverence in Chinese culture. It involves kneeling and bowing so low as to have one’s head touching the ground. The person kowtowing may also knock their head repeatedly against the ground (to the point of injury), especially when they’re desperately pleading for something or wish to show their utmost sincerity.

**[Clasped Hands](http://i.imgur.com/XRDMPWP.jpg)** (抱拳 bàoquán) (拱手 gǒngshǒu) – also translated as Cupped Fist or Cupped Hands. A respectful salute or greeting.

**[Pavilion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_pavilion)** (阁 gé) (亭 tíng) – a type of building. The pavilions in these novels probably look more like [this](http://i.imgur.com/1z1vFIB.jpg), rather than [this](http://i.imgur.com/NmJQjzR.jpg).

**[Pagoda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagoda)** (塔 tǎ) – a tiered tower with multiple, prominent eaves. Often has a religious function or is considered sacred.

**Immortal’s Cave** (洞府 dòngfǔ) – also translated as Cave Estate or Immortal Estate. The abode of a cultivator. Often high up in the mountains in a cave where spiritual energy is abundant. Similar to a [Grotto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grotto-heavens) (洞天).

**[Fairy](http://i.imgur.com/kOHcjqP.jpg)** (仙女 xiānnǚ) (仙子 xiānzǐ) – a term used to describe a woman of _otherworldly_ beauty.

- _Note: Not to be confused with the Western concept of Fairies._

**[Lotus Flower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelumbo_nucifera#Cultural_significance)** (莲花 liánhuā) – symbolizes purity & enlightenment in Chinese culture. Appears quite often in these novels.

[**Jade**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_jade) (玉 yù) – a type of gemstone that was more valuable than gold in Ancient China. It was even thought to have mystical powers/properties and to be associated with the soul and immortality. In cultivation novels, magical items are often made from jade. And anything beautiful, refined, or lustrous is commonly described as being “Jade-like”.

- Jade comes in two types: [Jadeite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadeite) and [Nephrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephrite). Jadeite is usually a vivid green color, and this is what Westerners are more familiar with. Nephrite comes in many colors, one of which is a creamy white. This white jade is called “mutton-fat jade” (羊脂玉) by the Chinese, and they consider it to be the most valuable kind of jade.

**[Incense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incense_in_China)** (香 xiāng) – aromatic material which releases fragrant smoke when burned. Used in religious ceremonies, to aid in meditation, and in many other cultural activities. [Incense Sticks](http://i.imgur.com/5q57iRH.jpg) (or [Joss Sticks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incense#Joss_sticks)) are frequently mentioned in these novels.

- “The time it takes an incense stick to burn” is a common phrase which refers to a short time period – generally around either 5 or 30 minutes. Other ancient Chinese time measurements can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/noveltranslations/comments/4az3tg/ancient_chinese_measurements_of_time/).

**Killing Intent** (煞气 shàqì) – a murderous aura which emits from a person when they desire to harm someone. People who have experienced bloody battles and/or have already killed others tend to have much stronger Killing Intent than an ordinary person. Experts may be able to disguise their Killing Intent, as well as intentionally release it as a form of mental attack.

**Sword Intent** (剑意 jiànyì) – somewhat similar to Killing Intent. A dangerous aura emitted from a sword or master swordsman which causes others to feel as if they’re about to be cut by a sword. In some novels, experts can even create physical manifestations (consisting of energy and their knowledge of sword-arts) with their Sword Intent, and this can be used to attack their foes.
