Prison system for the empire and its main city , most sect don't use prisons or have them because they kill people who commit crimes and there aren't many that dare to because sect city's are mostly guarded and made out of warriors of that sect even if they are in common clothes so its more of a city of people who follow or believe in that sect so most would steal or murder and those that do are punished by death , if there are important prisoners to keep alive the cit might have a Small prison but its more of a wooden stable like with wooden big cages nothing and the prisoner wear a cloth held by two strings on their face so they cant see which makes it difficult to escape or to know what is happening around them its more guarded so even if the break the wood cage the guards would notice so there is no need to make the prisons more secure. But for the empire its different because they much more prisoners and not that many guard so they built a underground prison with steel cages and cell that are underground so its harder to brake out and the guards are set at parts of the prison and go in shift walking around the cells to see if everything is okay most prisoners that commit heinous crime are punished by death others might get a flogging or a sentence.


Life potential: a technique that make the user turn his life force into qi meaning they know they are about to die and as a last resort use their life force and turn it to qi just to fight on knowing they will die either way, and the life potential also increases the strength of the user because the life  energy is more pure than qi , life energy is accumulated from birth till death and is difrente to qi because its more of a soul and u cant cultivate it , it grows on its own no matter what a person does, its a good idea for a character near death to use it in a ultimate battle or a boss using it as a last resort or final form as a last part off the battle

For very powerful battles and people in the game use a mini world of a kind different fro each of them in which they fight which will give freedom to make massively destructive moves and techniques

Concept: Decline of the Sects & Martial Arts
 **Gradual Fade of Qi and Martial Arts:** As the empire stabilizes and modernizes, the ancient ways of qi manipulation and powerful martial arts begin to wane. This could be due to political suppression, loss of knowledge, or a shift in spiritual energy.    
**Disappearance of Sect Influence:** The sect alliance that once held immense power starts fracturing, shrinking, or becoming secretive and underground. Some martial artists go into hiding or lose their abilities over generations.
 **The Last Heir:** A young martial artist claims to be the last true qi master, hunted by empire agents trying to suppress the old arts.
 **Sect Underground:** Secret sects operate in shadows, training in hidden monasteries and plotting resurgence.
 **Forbidden Techniques:** Lost manuals or relics emerge, tempting power-hungry warlords or scholars.
**Empireâ€™s New Age:** The empire expands with new tech and politics, but at what cost to tradition and balance?
