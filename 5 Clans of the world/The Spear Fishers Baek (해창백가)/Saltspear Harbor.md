Saltspear Harbor - Capital of Spear Fishers Baek (Haechang Province)

A weathered harbor settlement carved into salt-worn cliffs, looking more like a large fishing village than a proper city. Wooden piers stretch into storm-battered waters where Baek fishing boats and naval vessels dock. Buildings are simple - driftwood and stone with clay tiles, built low and sturdy against the constant sea winds.

**Key Features:**

- **The Great Docks:** Massive wooden pier complex where the Baek fishing fleet and imperial naval vessels dock
- **Spear Forges:** Simple waterfront workshops where master smiths craft the clan's legendary fishing spears
- **Storm Watchtowers:** Stone towers on cliff edges to spot incoming weather and enemy ships
- **The Tanning Yards:** Where the sun-darkened Baek work leather and prepare their catches
- **Tide Markets:** Busy waterfront markets that change with the tides, full of maritime goods

The tanned, practical Baek people work constantly - mending nets, forging spears, loading ships. Even the clan head lives in a modest stone house overlooking the harbor. No fancy mansions, just honest work and the smell of salt and dried fish everywhere.
