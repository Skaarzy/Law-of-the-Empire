[[Childhood Baek]]

**Background:**  
Baek Jang-Goon rose from a lifetime of sea raids, monster hunts, and naval battles. In his youth, he was called the “Whale Child” for spearing a colossal whale alone a feat unmatched in recorded history. Decades later, in a moment of boredom during a calm fishing season, he went out alone and speared a second one just to prove he hadn’t slowed down.
He became the Empire’s _Admiral of the Tides_ after defending Haechang from pirate coalitions and foreign incursions. Turning down honors from the capital, he chose to rule his people directly — by salt and sea, not silk and scroll.He looks messy with long black hair and beard is tall not too buff meaning not big muscles but fit and thin because of not having too much food (mostly eating fish and marine life),wear almost always a big straw hat and smokes long Changyan pipe, and wears loose clothes,usually has with him a zucchini bottle filled with sea water which he takes wiht him if he goes on longer trips farther inland. His weapon is a massive spear like harpoon over 7 feet long, forged from ship-steel(scraped metal from broke cannons)  and handle out a bone of a whale jaw,the sea qi he uses is so destructive,wild and untamed those who went against it say its like a massive sea tycoon hit them, 
**Personality:**  
He is a man of few words, choosing action over rhetoric. He trains with the youngest of his clan, eats with common fishermen, and sharpens his own spear. His loyalty is absolute, his expectations simple: earn your salt, or drown.He doesn't like cities or luxurious and loud places, but when he finds someone he like he becomes quite extroverted and outgoing.
**Rumors:**  
Some say he once hurled his spear through five ships in one throw. Others claim the tides shift when he walks the shore. But all agree: only Baek Jang-Goon can slay a whale whenever he wants even if its just out of boredom.
