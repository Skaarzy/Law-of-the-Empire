**Overview**
Rooted in the salt-worn cliffs and storm-battered shores of Jungsan, the Baek Clan is one of the oldest bloodlines in the coastal provinces. Their strength lies not in courtly power or spiritual cultivation, but in their absolute mastery of the spear that they use as a harpoons— an art sharpened through generations of life-and-death hunting on open water. With sin-weed(from fishing hooks) arms and eyes trained to strike through rain and foam, Baek warriors are said to harpoon fish the size of boats and skewer them as deep as 100 meters with bare hands.
Once humble coastal protectors during the early Demon War, the Baek Clan rose in prominence after saving the Emperor’s naval fleet with only a few dozen longboats and harpoons. In recognition, the Empire granted them full control of the coastal fishing guilds and maritime trade routes. Since then, they have become **the Empire’s official naval enforcers and fishery overseers**, with their crest seen on sails from the Northern Reaches to the Southern Isles.
Their long-standing contract with the Empire is enforced not with politics, but with absolute competence — no pirate lives long in Baek-patrolled waters.
Sea Qi" The Baek bloodline carries saltwater in their veins, or so the elders claim when telling tales of their founder's forbidden love with a sea spirit. Whether truth or legend, the clan family can only channel qi by draining it directly from seawater - opening a vial or standing near the sea and they can drawing the ocean's spiritual essence into themselves. Their spear strikes crash with the force of breaking waves, and their movements flow like deadly currents. Each use depletes the sea qi strength so if they have a small vial or a wooden bottle they may last only a short battle with using qi making every technique a calculated risk of running dry. and that is why the baek family lives on the island surrounded by sea.
The Baek Clan’s signature martial art, **Tidepiercer Spear Arts**, is a brute-force, fluid style inspired by the ocean itself — relentless, crashing, but controlled. Warriors leap like flying fish, spin like whirlpools, and thrust like breaking waves. The style focuses on:
- **Wide, arcing sweeps** for crowd control.
- **Water-footing stances** to maintain balance on unstable ground.
- **Single-point bursts** for armor-piercing thrusts.
It has no defensive form — the Baek believe the sea rewards boldness, not hesitation.
**Power and Influence**
- **Control over all maritime shipping and fishery regulation.**
- **Strong alliance with the Imperial Court**, as their sea trade ensures coastal food supply and naval dominance.
- **Exclusive training rights** for the Empire’s coastal guards.
The Baek are feared and respected — not because of politics, but because _no one wants to fight a Baek on water_.
**Joining the Baek Clan**
The player, if born into the Baek Clan, starts with increased affinity to:
- Pole-arms and heavy weapons like great-sword and battleaxe.
- Naval or aquatic movement buffs.
- Trade route interactions and ship-based influence.
Leaving the clan to join a land-based sect would be seen as a betrayal of the sea — but some Baek outcasts have taken their tide-forged techniques to land, becoming brutal mercenaries or even sect disciples , or use the tradition of the whale hunter which is that if one hunts and catches a whale they have the choice of leaving the sect or staying and learning some more secret techniques of the clan u cant choose both even if u stay and the decide to leave the clan would hunt u down even if it means the clans demise.
