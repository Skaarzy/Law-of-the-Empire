**Baek Cheon-sim (백천심) "Thousand Hearts Baek"**

The starving fisherman ancestor of the Baek clan who lived in a poverty neighborhood on the old ruthless island with a family of 2 sons and a dead wife, for months he hadn't caught anything for his sons or himself even though he went fishing every dawn early and came home late but one early morning after a night of rain the sun shined through the clouds and finally the exhausted starving fisherman felt a pull on his fishing rod immediately he started to reel it in hoping for a half decent catch he struggled for hours until the fish gave up and once he pulled it out of the water he realized what he caught a massive golden koi fish, going by the stories fishermen tell he knew immediately what he caught it was the ten thousand year old golden koi which brought fortune and it's said his inner pill could make one man immortal, yet with one look in its eyes Baek realized it would be a sin to kill a being older than humanity itself with great sadness and doubt he released it. The sea seeing this act of selfless wisdom granted the power of its qi to the Baek and his future bloodline's connection to the sea forever..
