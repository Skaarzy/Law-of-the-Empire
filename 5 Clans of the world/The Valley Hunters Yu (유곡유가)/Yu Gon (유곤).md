**Background:**  
Yu Gon was once a free-riding caravan scout, chasing elk by day and singing by night. When his older brother fell to bandits, he inherited leadership unwillingly — but brought a golden age with him. Under his rule, the Valley Hunters became known not just as expert trackers, but the only group able to guarantee safe passage through Yugok's harsh, bandit-ridden cliffs.
He’s not a typical patriarch — wears half a shirt, and spends more time racing horses than signing orders. But when danger comes, Yu Gon rides first and jokes last.He look hot with a neatly cut beard also his body is fit with a defined muscles tone but not large body also has scars all over his body from animals and beast alike which he fought against and won, usually wears a loose hide of a massive tiger.His main weapon called **Tiger Fang** is Rhenium spear which was gifted to him by the grand-master Won Dae-gi who just happened to cross onto the then younger yu gon and saw his masterful skill as he almost killed the grand-master with his beast qi instincts but he failed because the weapon got broken in half by the grand-masters qi so the old man made him a promise to make him a weapon no qi user would ever be able to break making the young mans only weakness which is that he cant use solid qi and It was said to be one of only seven weapons ever personally approved by the Elder, and the only one gifted to an outsider without qi. now a less of a legendary weapon and the second called **Moon Piercer** which is less grand but has a higher emotionally meaning the bamboo longbow which was in the yu clan for generation and has its unique using style which is  "Drawing the Moon Piercer bow with both arms straight - the holding arm and the draw arm form a straight line across the body making the T pose. The bow earned its name from legends that one of Yu Gon's ancestors once shot the moon with it, but Yu gon uses it as a simple longbow and sometimes even a quickbow,
