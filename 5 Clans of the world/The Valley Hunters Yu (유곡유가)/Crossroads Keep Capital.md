Crossroads Keep Capital of Valley Hunters Yu (Yugok Province)

A bustling mountain town where multiple dirt roads converge before heading through thick forests and mountain passes. Built into terraced levels following the mountainside, with wooden Korean-style buildings overlooking lush green valleys below.

**Key Features:**

- **The Great Stables:** Massive horse complexes where the Yu breed their famous mounts
- **Caravan Rest:** Large courtyards and inns designed for merchant wagon trains
- **The Trading Posts:** Multi-story wooden buildings stocked with travel supplies
- **Forest Gate Checkpoints:** Where the Yu collect their "protection fees" from merchants
- **The Archery Ranges:** Training grounds built into the mountainside terraces
- **Valley Overlooks:** Scenic spots where wealthy merchants rest and plan routes

The sound of hooves on stone echoes constantly. Trading posts and inns line every road, ready to supply merchant caravans. Wooden bridges span rushing mountain streams, and everything thrives - thick forests, rich farming valleys, prosperous trade. The Yu live well here, their mounted archers patrolling the roads that bring them wealth and power.
