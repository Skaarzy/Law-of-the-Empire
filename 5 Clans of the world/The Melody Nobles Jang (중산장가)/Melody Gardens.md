**Melody Gardens** - Capital of Melody Nobles Jang (Haechang Province)

A seemingly ordinary city nestled in muddy, overgrown swamplands that becomes mysteriously quiet after dark. During the day, it looks unremarkable - modest wooden houses with traditional Korean tiled roofs built on stilts above the muddy ground.

**Key Features:**

- **The Tea House District:** Ordinary-looking buildings that host elegant musical performances
- **Lotus Pavilions:** Beautiful but modest structures built over the swampy waters
- **The Silent Streets:** Roads that empty completely when night falls
- **Hidden Performance Halls:** Secret venues disguised as normal houses
- **The Misty Gardens:** Overgrown areas where the Jang practice their defensive dance techniques

Everything seems normal and unremarkable during daylight - people go about regular business, children play, merchants sell goods. But when darkness falls, the streets empty and the city transforms. Soft music drifts from hidden halls where the Jang conduct their real cultural influence work.
