[[Jang Mi-Su (장미수)]]

**The Jang Clan of Haechang Province**

**해창장가 Haechang Jang-ga**
**Title:** _Hearts of Grace, Hands of Smoke_  
**Player Archetype:** Hand-to-hand evasion-based combatant using rhythm, dance, and redirection  
**Martial Lineage:** Mist-veil Rhythm Arts (운무율법) — a mesmerizing dance-based martial discipline focusing on graceful movement, misdirection, and flow control.
**Overview**
The Jang Clan is a family of radiant souls — dancers, musicians, poets, and storytellers who believe that life is to be lived, and the body is a song meant to be danced. They treat every day like a festival, every moment like a verse in a larger performance.
Rather than retreat into silence or discipline like other clans, the Jang embrace **joy** and **expression**. Their palaces are full of laughter and practice halls ring with melodies. To be Jang is to believe that beauty is not a luxury — it is survival, harmony, and even war.
While they appear carefree, the Jang have a deadly grace. Their martial art, _Mistveil Rhythm Arts_, relies on breath, tempo, and flowing movement to dodge and redirect attacks. They can turn an enemy's force back upon them with nothing but the sway of a sleeve or the pivot of a heel.
The Jang trace their origins to traveling bards and dancers who refused to live under anyone’s rule. Over time, their unmatched performances earned them noble status in Jungsan Province. They didn’t seize power — the people offered it, moved by the clan’s artistry and warmth.
Generations later, the Jang rule not with laws but with culture. They organize **festivals**, teach in **arts academies**, and host **annual celebration tournaments** where violence is masked in elegance. Young martial artists come to Jungsan to learn not only how to fight — but how to live beautifully.
While they may be mocked as unserious or soft by warlike clans, the Jang know a truth deeper than steel: **a person who dances cannot be controlled.**
Sound Qi The founder of the Jang Clan was discovered by the Plum Blossom Sect after their sect master heard her play and recognized her extraordinary talent. Under his guidance, she mastered the art of **sound qi** — channeling her inner energy through the music to weave powerful currents that defend, disrupt, and strike.The foudner was also give the sacred guqin from the plum blossom family which had the plum blossom qi infused in it thus it becomes not only an instrument of sublime beauty but also a conduit for the founder's unique martial prowess. This knowledge has passed through generations alongside the sacred instrument.

**Why They Remain in Power**
- **Cultural Celebration:** Their control over arts, entertainment, and seasonal festivals makes them beloved by the common people and nobles alike. They're the face of peace and celebration.
- **Martial Grace:** Their movement-based martial art is unpredictable and hard to read. They don't block — they **slip**. They don’t attack — they **redirect**.
- **Non-Political Charm:** They don’t scheme or infiltrate. They sing, smile, and laugh with everyone — even sect elders. It's hard to hate someone who plays the guqin while serving you tea.
- **Support from the People:** Every city square echoes with a Jang melody. They are _everywhere_, not because they conquer, but because people _invite_ them in.
**Player Role and Experience**
As a player from the Jang Clan, you begin as a performer — perhaps a dancer, drummer, or guqin prodigy — learning how to move in harmony with your breath and rhythm. Your martial journey is one of **timing**, **momentum**, and **emotional clarity**. dancing is your defense, movement is your power.You’ll be invited to courts and sects not for your strength, but your performance. Tasks might involve impressing sect leaders through display, helping lift village morale, or using dance to distract enemies while others fight. But when you choose to fight, your strikes are smooth, reactive, and almost impossible to follow.All are allowed to leave and enter the clan as they want but if one becomes a famous artist or dancer then its a different story because most people would know them u must decide between learning more from the upper and more skillful artist and Cland elder or pick one place where u will preform forever or just leave the clan.
You don’t fight to destroy. You fight to _restore flow_.
