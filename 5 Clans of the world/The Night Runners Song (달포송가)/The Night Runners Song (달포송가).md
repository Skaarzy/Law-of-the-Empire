**Overview**
The Song Clan is a shadow-bound bloodline that thrives in the night-shrouded streets and hidden harbors of Dalpo Province. Known as the unseen hand behind the province’s black market, smuggling operations, and secret intelligence, the clan’s influence stretches far beyond its borders — yet none can easily trace their reach. Masters of stealth and subterfuge, every member of the Song Clan is trained from birth in the Silent Veil Arts, blending deadly poison knowledge with unparalleled skills in lockpicking, silent assassination, and evasion. They move like ghosts in the night, striking swiftly and vanishing before their enemies can even react. The Song Clan originated from a notorious master thief centuries ago, famed for stealing the imperial jade seal under the noses of the palace guards. This legendary act cemented their place in the underworld and led to their rise as rulers of Dalpo’s shadow economy. Despite their covert nature, the Song Clan holds a near-monopoly on intelligence and espionage across multiple provinces, making them indispensable to powerful sects and nobles alike. Their web of spies and informants is said to reach even into the imperial court. Unlike many clans who openly control land or military power, the Songs’ strength is secrecy itself. Attempts by rival sects to eliminate them have always failed — they simply disappear or turn the hunters into the hunted. Stolen Shadow Qi Generations ago, a Song ancestor infiltrated the Black Forest Assassins and stole fragments of their shadow cultivation manual before escaping into the night. The incomplete technique grants Song leaders the ability to slip into existing shadows and move within darkness itself, but they cannot create or control shadows as the original masters could. They remain bound to whatever darkness already exists, making them formidable in dim alleys but helpless under the noon sun.
**Why They Remain in Power**
- **Control of Secrets:** Their vast network of spies, informants, and assassins ensures they know every whisper of rebellion or conspiracy.
- **Black Market Monopoly:** They control smuggling routes and forbidden goods, making them essential partners even for lawful powers.
- **Shadow Alliances:** The Song Clan trades information and favors with sects and nobles, ensuring mutual benefits and protection.
- **Mastery of Poisons:** Their knowledge of rare toxins allows them to remove threats discreetly and without bloodshed that draws attention.
**Player Role and Experience**
Choosing the Song Clan allows the player to step into the world of shadow warfare. The player can develop skills in silent movement, lock picking, assassination, and poison crafting. The path includes dangerous missions behind enemy lines, espionage, and making morally gray choices to manipulate power without ever showing their face.
Players who choose this clan can later decide whether to remain loyal to their bloodline’s shadowy codes or to defect and join a sect for more overt power and training — opening unique story-lines of betrayal, loyalty, and identity.To leave the Clan one can just decide to run away and keep hiding even though this clan is notorious for finding people and assassinating them when they least expect or earn the clans trust and become a inner disciple which are allowed to go out of the clan and join other organisations like sect or the empire but u must keep informing on the organisation u decide to join(these would be side-quest of no importance if they are failed unless u fail more than 10 then another inner disciple can appear randomly and attack u as a warning)
