Song Hyejin The Silent Shade (송혜진 조용한 그늘)

Born into slavery under the harsh rule of Dalpo Province’s corrupt masters, the ancestor of the Night Runners Song clan endured endless chains and cruelty. His body was bound, but his spirit remained unbroken. One day, he managed to escape and lived for years in the shadows, hidden so well that no one knew he was still alive—he had no family left. After a fateful night spent in the Black Forest, home to an unorthodox sect of assassins ten times more powerful than ordinary killers, he was gifted a fragment of their shadow adapting technique. He adapted this technique to his own style and slowly began building a reputation as a relentless killer of inslavers and criminals. Over time, he gained followers and helpers bit by bit until he successfully created a clan, sworn to protect the oppressed from the darkness.
