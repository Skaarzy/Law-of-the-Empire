**Title:** _The Silk Phantom_  
**Role:** Matriarch of the Song Clan — Dalpo’s Night Runners  
**Age:** Early 40s  
**Weapon:**Massive katana like whip sword and a folding fan with poison needles  
**Fighting Style:** Graceful deception. Hwa-Rin turns defense into opportunity, striking only when the odds are silent and certain.

**Background:**  
Born during a blood feud between rival smuggler factions, Song Hwa-Rin was trained in espionage before she could write her own name. Raised within the veiled corridors of Dalpo’s undercity, she unified the fragmented black markets under a single code: profit with precision. Unlike her forebears, she kept no armies — only networks, traps, and a terrifying reputation for knowing _everything_. Hwa-Rin is known to attend imperial balls and dockside brawls with equal poise, and using the clans secret shadow techniques in her own style making her apear and disapera without a trace and she is said to have a smile no one trusts. She never kills when she can control — and she always controls. Her weapons are what make her unique as she made them herself so they fit her shadow qi way, she does have multiple dagger and gadgets like smoke bombs and poison perfume, but the main two are the massive katana like whip sword which has a mechanism which allows the wielder to detach the sword into loose segments and hide it as a belt or in a sleeve the part of the blade are connected with a steel wire which lets her control it as a whip hence the name whip sword the actual mechanism was create by hwa-rin herself entire mechanism fits in the handle of the sword and with just a push of a button u can detach or reattach the blade parts, and the second creation of hers a folding fan which has allows the user to insert poison needles inside of every overlapping ridge making it inconspicuous and looking like a ordinary fan but with a simple push of a button that on the handle of the fan it releases the needles flying , the mechanism is a simple spring release mechanism and to reload the needles u just fold the fan back and insert a wooden box which fits the fan perfectly and has needles exactly where the folded fans holes for them are acting like a magazine it unlike the sword doesn't need to be hidden as its mostly used in dire situations in public places.
**Personality:**  
Charming, cryptic, and utterly calculating. She enjoys riddles, veiled threats, and people who think they’re smarter than her. Hwa-Rin doesn’t command with authority — she _owns_ with leverage.
**Rumors:**  
It’s said she has five doubles acting in her place, and that she signs her secret messages with a pressed lotus soaked in rare ink. Some say even sect leaders send messengers _instead_ of letters, for fear she’s already read them.
