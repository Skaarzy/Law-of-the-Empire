**Dust Crown Settlement** - Capital of Night Runners Song (Dalpo Province)

A sprawling tent city mixed with permanent wooden structures, built across the hot stone plains like a frontier colony. Most "buildings" are large canvas tents reinforced with wooden frames, designed to be moved if needed. The permanent structures are simple wood and stone - practical, not pretty.

**Key Features:**

- **The Night Market:** A maze of tents that only truly comes alive after dark
- **Smuggler's Row:** Permanent wooden warehouses where "legitimate" goods are stored
- **The Watering Holes:** Sturdy wooden taverns that serve as information exchanges
- **Dust Roads Central:** Where all the secret trade routes converge and diverge
- **The Stone Peaks Lookout:** Watchtowers built on the jutting stone formations

During the day it bustles with legitimate traders, but at night the real Song business begins. Tanned people in loose, practical clothing move through dusty streets. Everything has a ready-to-move feeling - because sometimes it needs to be.
