[[Hwan Se-Jin (환세진)]]


**The Hwan Clan of Yangpo Province**
**(양포환가 – Yangpo Hwan-ga)**  
**Title:** _Ledgers of Heaven, Blades of Precision_  
**Player Archetype:** Counter/combo fighter using swift rapier strikes, perfect timing, and balance control  
**Martial Lineage:** _Celestial Balance Doctrine (천균법)_ — a disciplined sword art rooted in debt, precision, and divine reciprocity.

**Overview**
The Hwan Clan doesn’t raise its voice. It doesn’t raise its blade until the exact second you’ve made a mistake. And by then, you’re already bleeding. Masters of numbers, contracts, and consequences, the Hwan rule Yangpo not through emotion or popularity — but through **discipline**, **order**, and **unshakable logic**. They are the realm’s most respected moneylenders, land assessors, and financial keepers. Their word is literal currency.Their martial art, _Celestial Balance Doctrine_, is based on the same principles that govern ledgers: **every action has a cost**. If you strike wildly, they strike surgically. If you leave a gap, they collect on it. Their signature rapier style uses ultra-fine footwork, linear thrusts, and calculated pauses to bait, punish, and reset the flow of battle.
**Clan History and Power**
Long ago, the Hwan were advisors to the imperial court, sent to Yangpo to “restore order” after a civil trade collapse. Within a decade, they owned the region's debts. Within two, they owned the region. And unlike other clans, they never had to fight for it.
The Hwan believe in hierarchy, records, and quiet dominance. A proper debt must be honored. An insult must be repaid — not emotionally, but mathematically. When conflict arises, it’s solved either at the table… or in the garden ring, where Hwan duelists end disputes in three moves or less.
Perception Qi  The elegant rapier blueprint weren't the only thing that was found in the hwan vault there more than just blueprints the trade between the founder of the hwan clan and the foreign trader package included weird cultivation notes from distant lands. The Hwan adapted these mysterious reading techniques into their own Perception Qi, allowing clan leaders to perceive the exact spiritual weight of their opponents, sense movements before they happen, and strike with mathematical precision. The qi reveals all debts the body owes every opening, every weakness, every moment of imbalance ready to be collected upon.Its like they can see the qi move and react.

**Why They Remain in Power**
- **Economic Supremacy:** Every sect, province, and merchant prince owes the Hwan. Even warlords who hate them still borrow from them. Their contracts are sacred and binding.
- **Divine Precision:** Their martial art is near unbeatable when it comes to reading openings, exploiting errors, and staying calm under pressure. Their doctrine teaches that imbalance is sin — and they punish it.
- **Cold Reputation:** Their image is clean, elite, and detached. They’re rarely accused of scandals because they don’t react emotionally or impulsively.
- **Imperial Endorsement:** The Empire trusts them to monitor finances and collect taxes. They’re too useful to remove — and too precise to ever overstep.

**Player Role and Experience**
As a Hwan player, you begin as a youth trained in both accounts and balance. You understand **measured action** — both in martial combat and in your choices. Your attacks will be fewer, but every one of them is **deliberate and brutal**. You don’t brawl — you **calculate**. You don’t overwhelm — you **punish mistakes**.
You may receive quests involving tracking debts, resolving dishonored contracts, or stepping into silent duels where only one strike is allowed. In politics, your presence is chilling. In battle, it is swift and final.To leave the clan is possible but like everything else u need to pay what is owed to them they actually keep account on what they thought u and what favors they did for u and what u did for them when all of it calculated then they give u a number that you must pay if u want to leave the sect the debt doesn't need to be payed in coin or currency but favor can pay the debt as well or some even give the sect years of their life .If u stay and climb the ranks u gain more and more benefits but then the cost of leaving also increase
Because they think of themselves heavenly they have 2 catchphrases
Blood stains. Ledgers don’t and Even justice accrues interest

**Weaknesses:**
- **Precision Dependency:** Their martial art requires perfect timing and reading opponents - against chaotic or multiple simultaneous attacks, their calculated approach breaks down
- **Contract Obsession:** Their rigid adherence to formal agreements prevents them from taking profitable risks that don't fit their systematic approach - they miss opportunities because they won't act without proper contracts
 they want to move from being feared loan sharks to being respected financial pillars of society. The contract obsession weakness is particularly clever because it shows how their greatest strength (systematic approach) is also their limitation (can't adapt to informal opportunities).
