**Golden Ledger City** - Capital of Coin Counters Hwan (Yangpo Province)

An elegant city of white stone and polished wood, with sweeping Korean-style curved roofs decorated with Chinese golden dragons and phoenixes. Wide paved streets connect beautiful courtyards filled with ornamental gardens and koi ponds. Everything here screams wealth and refinement.

**Key Features:**

- **The Central Bank:** A magnificent multi-story building where all major loans and debts are managed
- **Noble Quarters:** Refined residential district with marble mansions and private gardens
- **Merchant's Plaza:** Grand marketplace with covered stalls selling luxury goods
- **The Counting Houses:** Elegant buildings where Hwan accountants work with silk-dressed clerks
- **Golden Bridge District:** Wealthy area connected by ornate stone bridges over flowing streams

The Hwan maintain their heavenly noble demeanor here - silk robes, polished shoes, perfect manners. But beneath the beauty lies the iron discipline of debt collection. Uniformed guards patrol quietly, and everyone knows debts must be paid.
