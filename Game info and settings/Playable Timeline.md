The third and fourth part are about the empire and the imperial court and the emperors.Even though the empire won the eternal war and the people celebrated and were relived that it was finally over and hoped for a golden age and happy future of the empire, but the truth was that the empire suffered more that it lead on
THE FIRST PART OF IT: About the empire's struggle after the war and the conflicts of the imperial court, and the ending of it should be the separation of sects and empire. The empire suffered more that it led even though the empire won and didn’t suffer many casualties, it did suffer internally within the imperial court. Immediately after the demon war, some of the court officials became scared and wary of the sects and their immense powers they showed in the war, so those officials tried to convince the emperor to inflict new laws and limitations for the sects, and in the end they succeeded in implementing those laws and getting them approved by the emperor, which made the sects and their leaders very furious and in the end caused the separation of the sects and the empire, which made the sects as well as the empire vulnerable.
**THE SECOND PART IS:** About the empire’s struggles with the people and the whole economy and still the problem in the imperial court which leads to the coup and death of the emperor, with the people being on the side of Dong Zhou. And in the middle of that the sects make an alliance and are trying to organize and distance themselves from the empire, that’s why they don’t help to stop the coup. And the sects also struggled as well because the separation of the empire meant they needed to supply and take care of their own distribution of food, money, housing, and they had to take care of their people in general. That way they made an alliance. After all of that, near the end there should be a part where the sects in the end help the empire in exchange for an alliance with the empire and letting them be independent, which happens, and they remove Dong Zhou from the throne and the actual heir takes his place, which should be the end.
