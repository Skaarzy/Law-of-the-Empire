Main game Logic : Dao, eventually does not refer to a singular path. There is no distinction between good and evil in Dao, and that is why there are no Good people or Bad people in Dao. No matter what anyone says there is never a wrong answer, think of Dao as being singular.
 
FEW QUOTES FOR THE MAIN SCREEN:
-In Law, there is order. In Nature, there is freedom. Between them, you shape your life.
-Some seek mastery. Others, peace. Few realize Nature holds both, and neither.
-The Empire writes law with ink and steel. But Destiny belongs to no one.
-Mountains endure, rivers shift, and names fade. Walk as a beggar, a warlord, or a whisper in the trees—Destiny remains yours alone.

THE MAIN SCREEN : 
- **Visuals:**
    - Menu options appear on the scroll made out of a messy and yet precise ink font,
    - The scroll lies flat on the shiny dark wooden council table, on the left side is a half opened scroll on screen with elegant black calligraphy text appearing on it.
        
    - The Emperor’s red seal sits prominently on the upper right side of the scroll, glossy and detailed with gold filigree, under it is a ink paintbrush with ink puddle under it. The rest of the table is clean and shiny.
- **Interaction:**
    
    - when u go trough the menu options ink spots appear around the one u hover over, when u select a menu option the seal slams down HARD onto the scroll with a quick, sharp animation—like a heavy iron stamp hitting thick paper.
    
    - This is accompanied by a deep “THUMP” sound, echoing through the hall, leaving behind a vivid glossy red imprint  of a seal at the bottom right of the scroll.
    
    - The impact causes a subtle shake, emphasizing the force.
    
	- When the player chooses a option after the seal stamp the screen moves up like a person raising his head and the u see the full imperial hall from emperors point of view,then the camera starts to move towards the door of the hall the closer to the door the faster and before it reaches the the door they open and clouds and sky appear and under them mountain peaks barely seen and that will be the waiting screen until stuff loads
- **UI and Menu:**
    
    - Menu options appear on the scroll made out of a messy and yet precise ink font, the seal, 
    
    - Selecting an option triggers the seal slam, reinforcing the player’s decisive action.
- **Atmosphere:**
 Background remains the deep black lacquered hall with glowing red and gold highlights. With big Pillar on both sides of the hall with dragon decoration on them with lanterns on each and the door is dark brown wood or black wood with thing engraved in it and golden round handles like rings.The halls light is the lantern which emanate light but not fully so there are spots for shadow and darker spots
