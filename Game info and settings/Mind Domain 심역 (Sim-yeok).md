Usage: The Strongest rarely unleash their full power or realms in the mortal world, preserving the balance and preventing devastation.
**Meditation:** When increasing their qi, The Strongest retreat into their realms for extended training, where time flows differently a hour in the domain is a day in the mortal realm so sometime its called seclusion. Each Mind Domain reflects the userâ€™s spirit, experiences, and martial path. To enter one is to face the purest form of their power.
