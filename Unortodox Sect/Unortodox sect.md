** Unorthodox**
They're the martial world's pragmatists and outcasts who've found their own way. Not evil - just different, practical, and unwilling to conform to what others think martial arts "should" be.
They prove that strength and skill can come from anywhere, not just noble bloodlines and powerful families.The unorthodox sects do have treaty with the orthodox sects and the empire and its a scroll with 10 rules which was made by the 3 unorthodox and the 5 orthodox with the imperial court acting as a witness and its the [[Divine Vow]] which all must follow and the empire acts as the enforcer.

**Rejection of Imperial/Orthodox Authority**: They refuse to bow to imperial martial rankings, sect hierarchies, or "proper" martial traditions. They follow their own paths.
**Social Outcasts Welcome**: They accept disciples orthodox sects reject - the disabled, poor, weak ,deserters, foreigners, those without "proper" bloodlines or backgrounds.

**Unconventional Methods**: Their techniques work but aren't "respectable":
- Black Forest: Psychological warfare instead of honorable duels
- Heavenly Root: Treating criminals and outcasts equally
- Iron Palm: Extreme body conditioning seen as "brutish"
- Resonant Step: Relying on disability as strength
- Withering Lotus: Body restoration techniques through life force manipulation
- Wandering Blade: Desertion and weapon mastery without formal training

**No Moral Boundaries in Combat**: They fight dirty - ambushes, tricks, unconventional weapons, ganging up. Orthodox sects value "honorable" one-on-one combat with proper techniques.
**Cross-Provincial Service**: Orthodox sects only serve their own provinces and people. These unorthodox sects help and accept anyone from anywhere, ignoring territorial boundaries.

The 6 main unorthodox sects :

[[The Sect of the Severed Path]]

[[Black Forest Assassins]]

[[Withered Lotus sect]] 

[[Iron Palm Sect]]

[[The Sect of the Resonant Step]]

[[Heavenly Root Sect]]

Unlike the clans, the empire and the sects these 6 don't have a council or a monthly meeting they just follow the [[Book Untold Rules]] which is a sacred book created by the first 3 unorthodox sects which were the Iron Palm sect , the Black Forest Assassins , and the Heavenly Root Sect which are considered the elder unorthodox sects and their influence goes back decades and those 3 are the only ones that had multiple sect leaders meaning they had successions, and they are the ones to enforce those rules or even punish those who don't follow them.After the demon war the unorthodox sect faced too big of a crime increase which meant that the 3 elder couldn't keep order without slip ups so they created a new system with the book of untold rules still being the main rule book but adding two new laws and changing the enforcement system, now making each sect responsible for their own territory with the ability to appoint wardens and enforce the rule of the book of untold rules themselves after which a information report must be sent to the 3 elder who then check what is happening in each territory and voted if action is needed the new laws in the untold book is about the vote which stated that no one elder can be neutral or influenced by one of the other sects or side with one over the other because of favorability or having influence in that sect that applying to their own sect and that the vote must be clear for all elders must either agree or disagree if there is a 2 to 1 in either situation the other sect leader must be asked for opinion and if after that is a tie as there are 6 sect the vote which had the majority of elders agreed wins it ,cant be a tie as there are 3 elder and the elder cant be neutral as they added a new law to the untold book.The 3 elder meet when a decision and a vote is needed to the sect of which the problem is about its know to take days for a decision to be made
