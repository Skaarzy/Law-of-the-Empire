**Bái Hǔ Shān (白虎山)** — _White Tiger Mountain_ — is a remote, forest-covered peak hidden from maps and memory. Its jagged summit pierces the clouds, while its base is wrapped in ancient trees and thick mist. A cold, narrow river winds through the forest, weaving between scattered wooden villages that cling to the land with quiet stubbornness.Under the control of the iron palm sect 
There are only two larger villages and a handful of smaller ones, all made of worn timber and bark. Life here is hard. The soil is poor, the harvests thin, and the winters long. Yet the people do not leave. They stay not only because they have been _allowed_ to — but because they _choose_ to.
For those who live on Bái Hǔ Shān, the mountain offers more than survival. It offers protection, and a rare kind of peace. Many who live here came from chaos, from war, from betrayal. What they seek is not power or comfort, but stillness. The mountain’s silence is sacred. Its isolation is a gift. Here, life is slow, simple, and quiet — and that is exactly what they want.
But this peace has its price.
Iron palm sect watches over all. The leader of iron palm allows only those with calm hearts and hard souls to stay there. Outsiders who arrive with greed or violence are taken. And even villagers must follow their law: no uncesery blood may be spilled on the mountain. If a single bird is hunted, if a rabbit is killed, the one who does so will not see the next dawn.
Instead, the people survive on what little the land gives. They farm in poor soil, coaxing crops from earth that resists them. They forage carefully. For meat, they wait. Sometimesthe sect leaves a deer, boar, or wild fowl near the edge of the villages. These offerings are rare, but always timely.
The iron palm never lets them starve.
They gives just enough, never more, never less. The people do not ask for more, and they are never left without.
**Bái Hǔ Shān** is not a place for ambition or conquest. It is a place for those who have given up the world, or whom the world has given up on. Here, under the eye of iron palm, they find stillness and unbreakable character. And though they live humbly, they live untouched — beneath the trees, beside the river, in the calm breath of the mountain.

Names of smaller villages are :
1. **Jìnglín (静林)** – “Quiet Forest”  
    A peaceful, calm-sounding name that reflects the villagers’ way of life.
    
2. **Bái Mù Cūn (白木村)** – “Whitewood Village”  
    Evokes the White Tiger’s presence and the simple wooden homes.
    
3. **Hǔshēn (虎深)** – “Tiger's Depth”  
    Suggests the village lies deep within the territory protected by the White Tiger.
    
4. **Lánshuǐ (澜水)** – “Ripple Water”  
    Named after the small river that runs nearby; peaceful and natural.

    A poetic name symbolizing the quiet, shaded life under the forest canopy.


And the two main ones are :
**Lǜcǎo (绿草)  Green Grass** — is a  lively village where wild grasses grow thick and the people work hard to tend their crops despite the poor soil, there is no better anywhere else on the mountain.

**Mùzhái (木寨)  Wood Fort** — is a modest village built from sturdy timber, where simple wooden homes cluster tightly together for warmth and protection under the watchful gaze of the White Tiger.
