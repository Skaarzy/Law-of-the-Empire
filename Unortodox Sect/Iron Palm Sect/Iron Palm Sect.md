Sect master : [[Cheol Jang-jong (철장종) - The Unmoved Palm]] 
**Philosophy**: _"Strength flows from within, but only discipline shapes it."_  
The Iron Palm Sect is a powerhouse of internal strength and external mastery. Founded deep in the storm-beaten mountains where only the toughest survive, the sect believes the human body can be refined beyond the limits of flesh. Through unyielding discipline, meditation, and brutal training, disciples of the Iron Palm Sect harden their bodies into living weapons. Every strike is a calculated fusion of breath, force, and inner energy, turning muscle and bone into tools of pure destruction.Training in the sect is relentless. Outer sect disciples strike ironwood trees for years, submerge their arms in heated sand and gravel, and meditate beneath freezing waterfalls until pain becomes silence. Their bodies are not only hardened they are disciplined instruments of will.
