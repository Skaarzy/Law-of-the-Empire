Sect master : [[Tang Ryeong (당령) - The Soundless Storm]]
The Sect of the Resonant Step is a silent and mysterious unorthodox sect, neither famous nor feared, but known about with deep respect among wandering martial artists and hermits of the outer provinces. Unlike the great sects that cultivate power through grand techniques or heavenly arts, the Resonant Step trains in something far more subtle: sound, rhythm, and vibration. Its members believe that true mastery comes not from overwhelming force, but from perfect understanding of movement off sound. Most of its disciples are humble fighters, with little to no spiritual background, and among them are many who are blind, deaf, or considered broken by conventional sect standards, people who have found purpose through the sect’s unique teachings. They are taught to “see without eyes, hear without ears,” using the echoes of steps, the pressure of air, and the tremors of motion to perceive the world in a way few can. Their martial forms are not flashy they flow like a conversation between body and ground, often leaving enemies confused, off-balance, or disarmed without realizing how. . The Sect of the Resonant Step holds no temple, no flags, and no loyalty to any government or greater school, they walk the edge of rivers, caves, and towns, unnoticed but ever listening, training those few who are patient enough to hear the world in ways others never will.Their home is that of the disciples who give it to the sect as a resting place away from rain to the old and frail the higher disciples of the sect mostly wander around the world some are healer and some just live their life .
