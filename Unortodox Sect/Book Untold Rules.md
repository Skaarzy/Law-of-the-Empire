### Sacred Code of the Six Unorthodox Sects
**No harm without cause**  
Do not kill or maim members of the other unorthodox sects without just reason. Honor grudges, but avoid senseless massacres or endless vendettas.

**Respect the untold path**  
Each sect walks its own way. Do not interfere with another sect’s methods, secrets, or territories unless invited or necessary for survival.

**No theft among brethren**  
Do not steal from fellow unorthodox members. Sharing resources and information strengthens all; betrayal weakens everyone.

**Keep the Book untold**  
The teachings and rules of the Book Untold must not be revealed to outsiders or orthodox sects. Only the master of each sect may read the Book. The veil of mystery is the source of our strength.

**Share your path’s secrets**  
Each sect must record their secret techniques and knowledge in the Book as a sign of loyalty and to protect the other five sects. This ensures no sect is left vulnerable or blindsided.

**No aggression on orthodox lands**  
No sect may attack an orthodox sect or seize its territory without the agreement of the other five unorthodox sects. Balance must be maintained between the untold and the orthodox.

**Aid those cast out**  
Disciples must offer shelter, healing, or counsel to those rejected by orthodox schools — the disabled, the poor, the forsaken. We are their last refuge.

**Fight with cunning, not cruelty**  
Unorthodox does not mean wanton brutality. Use guile, surprise, and strategy to defeat enemies  but needless cruelty weakens the soul and the sect.

**Guard the shadow’s silence**  
Our deeds must remain whispered in the dark. Exposure invites persecution. Silence is survival . Those who try to expose us shall be prosecuted

**The path is personal**  
Each disciple must forge their own way. Traditions guide but do not bind. Respect freedom in all who walk the untold path

**of forbidden arts requires unanimous consent**  
If a sect wishes to use particularly dark or forbidden techniques that might harm the balance, it must first receive approval from all five other sect masters.

**Masters must personally train their successors**  
A master cannot simply name a successor; they must personally mentor and test their chosen heir to ensure true loyalty and capability.

**No recruiting from within another sect**  
Disciples cannot be poached from another unorthodox sect to prevent internal instability and preserve mutual respect.

**No alliances with imperial forces**  
Unorthodox sects shall never form official alliances or partnerships with imperial or orthodox authorities to maintain their independence and avoid manipulation.

NEW LAWS AFTER THE ETERNAL WAR :
**Duty of Enforcement**
**Each sect shall govern its own territory.**  
Sects may appoint wardens to enforce the Untold Code within their domain. The sect leader must report major events to the Three Elders, who will vote on further action.

**Order of the Three**
**Elders must remain impartial and indivisible.**  
No Elder may show bias or hold favor toward any sect, including their own. All decisions must be unanimous or judged by the weight of the impartial voice when tied.


### Possible Loopholes & Exploits

 **“No harm without cause”** —  
_Loophole:_ What qualifies as “just reason”? Vague enough that a sect could justify attacks as “necessary,” sparking hidden vendettas or proxy wars disguised as justice.

**“Respect the untold path”** —  
_Loophole:_ “Invited or necessary for survival” is subjective. A sect could claim survival needs to spy, sabotage, or even assassinate another sect under this guise.

**“No theft among brethren”** —  
_Loophole:_ What counts as “theft”? Could information be stolen by trickery or disguised as “sharing” in exchange for false promises? Also, stealing from disciples who left a sect might not be covered.

**“Keep the Book untold” & “Only masters may read”** —  
_Loophole:_ Masters could secretly share knowledge selectively, or use the book to manipulate others without consequences. Also, no rule forbids forging or falsifying entries in the Book.

**“Share your path’s secrets”** —  
_Loophole:_ If a sect deliberately withholds or lies about its true secret techniques, it could gain an unfair advantage while technically obeying the code.

**“No aggression on orthodox lands without consensus”** —  
_Loophole:_ What if a sect uses proxies or criminals to attack orthodox lands indirectly? Or stages false flag attacks to provoke others?

**“Aid those cast out”** —  
_Loophole:_ A sect could exploit this as a recruitment pool for spies or saboteurs, under the guise of charity.

**“Fight with cunning, not cruelty”** —  
_Loophole:_ “Needless cruelty” is subjective. Psychological warfare, torture disguised as “interrogation,” or destruction of property might be argued as “necessary.”

**“Guard the shadow’s silence”** —  
_Loophole:_ Enforcement is unclear. How to deal with insiders who leak secrets or outsiders who gather rumors? Does “prosecution” mean exile, assassination, or something else?

**“Unanimous consent for forbidden arts”** —  
_Loophole:_ One sect could block consent indefinitely to stall rivals, or force others to agree by political pressure.

**“Masters must personally train successors”** —  
_Loophole:_ Masters could choose incompetent heirs for political gain or to weaken a sect intentionally.

**“No recruiting from within another sect”** —  
_Loophole:_ What if a disciple leaves voluntarily? Can a sect then recruit them? Also, covert poaching could happen under false pretenses.

**“No alliances with imperial forces”** —  
_Loophole:_ Secret deals or unofficial collaborations might happen, with plausible deniability for involved parties.
