[[Cho-yak (초약) - The Ancient Herbmaster]]

Heavenly Root Sect is a humble collection of village herbalists and healers scattered throughout Hyeopdo Province, known for their expertise in medicinal plants and natural remedies. On the surface, they appear as simple folk who gather mountain herbs, brew healing potions, and treat common ailments for travelers and locals alike. The sect specializes in plant cultivation techniques, poison antidotes, and herbal medicine, often using unconventional methods that earn them an "unorthodox" reputation among imperial physicians. Their members are trusted healers who ask no questions when treating patients, whether they be merchants, bandits, or outcasts, following the belief that all life deserves healing.
In reality, the Heavenly Root Sect serves as an elaborate front for demon cultists, using their reputation as healers to move freely throughout the empire without suspicion. Their knowledge of poisons allows them to eliminate targets quietly, while their healing expertise helps them blend seamlessly into rural communities where they recruit new members and gather sacrificial victims for dark rituals.
