He is a figure that is said to guard the entrance of the main city of black forest assassins. He looks like an old man dressed in clean and neat clothes and look really out of place. No one knows his origin, or even if he is entirely human. Some say he’s the first assassin, long retired. Others believe he’s the forest itself in human form.His voice is like dry wind through leaves. His movements are silent. He doesn’t threaten he simply appears, and his presence alone turns invaders cold with dread. Many who try to enter the city but are not invited die without ever seeing how.He is know trough the world as a immortal but many has not seen his face and would not guess he is a immortal emperor who could defeat most.His power is the forest he controls it he maintains it and he is it, from making the forest shift to controlling its vines and even opening the ground and devouring things into it.When he is out of it which is rarely he still brings a part of the forest with his which is a bell which is made of the elder tree(first and oldest tree of the forest) with which he controls and can call upon roots of the forest anywhere that is how strong the forest and the immortals power is.His body even tough looking like a real human is partly made of the forest and some say his blood is green even.He is also know for his healing powers and techniques and because the forest has MANY spiritual and rare healing herbs and plants which he protects.For actual fighting techniques he uses his palms and feet similar to the nine fingered beggar it a weird and more of a flow than technique.The power of his Qi is immense and maybe even infinite meaning if he wanted he could turn the whole world into the forest or if he use a technique similar to those of a sword slash he could cut the world in half.He is also the neutral party in the eternal war not wanting to meddle in it, but near the end he does and takes the side of the empire.Most of his desciples and sect people are free and aren't required to follow a sect order or request even though there are laws most disciples and master have their own interest and opinions so some helped the demons and some helped the empire, which didn't bother the old immortal
