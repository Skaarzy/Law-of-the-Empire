Grandmaster : [[Ya Yeong (야영) - Nightshade]]
The Black Forest Assassins Sect does not see itself as mere killers but as agents of inevitability. They believe that death should come naturally, like the slow withering of leaves or the silent decay of a fallen tree. Their assassinations are not quick or merciful; they are drawn-out, precise, and psychologically devastating Their assassins train in stillness rather than speed, patience rather than aggression. They do not strike first—they make the enemy fear what might  be lurking, until that fear itself becomes the killing blow. Yè Yǐng(夜影)(Nightshade)  A ghost in the trees, a whisper in the dark his victims never see him, only feel the cold embrace of death.Yè Yǐng perfected this art. His techniques are so refined that victims often surrender before a blade is ever drawn. He does not chase. He does not run. He waits until his target is too afraid to resist. To the world, he is barely a rumor. Among the few who know of him, he is the final breath of autumn — silent, still, and always fatal.

Sect hierarchy :
- Grandmaster  
    The supreme leader of the sect. Commands absolute authority.  
    Current holder: Ye Ying (Nightshade). Rarely seen. Issues orders only when necessary.
    
- [[Shadow Elders]]  
    A secretive council of veteran assassins. Each oversees part of the sect — training, intelligence, internal justice, etc. They answer only to the Grandmaster.
    
- [[Night Commanders]]   
    Senior assassins who lead squads, train promising members, and handle regional operations. Each may specialize in a particular method: poison, stealth, manipulation, etc.
    
- [[Veiled Shadows]] 
    Core disciples. Not yet elite, but trusted. Sent on missions to prove themselves and gather information. Often trained under a Silent Blade or Commander.
    
- [[Outer Forest Disciples]] 
    Recruits and lower-tier members. Handle simple missions, errands, and sect support work. Few ever rise beyond this level.
    
- [[Shadowborn]] 
    The lowest class — orphans, captives, or indebted children forced into servitude. Used for labor, bait,spies or dangerous assignments. Most die or disappear and those that dont become outer forest disciples when they reach age of 14.
