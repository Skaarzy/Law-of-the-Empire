A forest that gained its name because no sun ever enters it and most living things avoid it only things like snakes, bugs and some birds that live in the trees are there but even they are rare.Its also the main capital and land of the [[Black Forest Assassins]] who guard the forest and see it as a sacred place which none should touch.Nobody knows realy where the [[Black Forest Assassins]] main city/capital is but it is told that the capital is guarded/surounded by a thick fog which is made out of poison.The capital name is [[Geun Ha-yeong (근하영) - Shadow Beneath the Root]]
