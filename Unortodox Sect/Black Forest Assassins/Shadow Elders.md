The Silent Roots Beneath the Forest
The Shadow Elders are the oldest surviving masters of the Black Forest Assassins — those who have passed beyond the need for blades or missions, yet remain bound to the sect like roots to an ancient tree. They are not retired. They have simply grown too deep, too still, and too dangerous to be wasted on ordinary killing.
Each elder is a reflection of the sect’s core belief: that death is not to be rushed, only _realized_. They are scholars of fear, artists of decay. They no longer act in the open; instead, they shape the sect's future from the shadows — choosing who rises, who falls, and who is sent to die. Their presence is rarely felt directly, but their influence is everywhere: in the choice of targets, the structure of training, the punishments whispered in the dark.
Some are thought to have fused with the forest itself, living deep in the ancient groves, their minds drifting between memory and silence. Others walk among the sect unseen, testing disciples with illusions, riddles, or sudden fear.
Every Shadow Elder once stood at the edge of madness — because to master the Black Forest’s art is to flirt with oblivion. Only those who return with their minds intact are invited to join their ranks. It is said that even Yè Yǐng consults the elders from time to time, not for guidance, but for confirmation — that the stillness he brings is true.
They are the keepers of forgotten techniques, forbidden rituals, and the sect’s only law: death must never be wasted.




Baek Ryeong (백령) - Red Shroud
A figure spoken of in whispers, Bai Ling is the most unsettling of the Shadow Elders. She once vanished into the heart of the forest and spent three years sealed within the hollow of an ancient tree. When she emerged, she walked with a wooden leg and bore a long katana chained into her wooden arm — as if the forest itself had claimed part of her soul. She hides her head beneath a red cloth, tied tight and never removed. Some say her face is wood, carved smooth and expressionless. Others believe she lost her face altogether. None have seen it and lived to speak clearly. She rarely speaks. Her silence weighs heavier than threats. The only sound that follows her is the faint creak and hollow thump or the soft rustle of her tattered cloak. Her katana does not slash it coils, and reaps. When she moves, death follows like falling leaves. They call her _Red Shroud_, not for the cloth she wears, but for the unseen death that wraps itself around her presence.

Heuk An (흑안) - Stormwing
Heiyan stands tall and imposing, clad in battered white armor stained by countless battles. His armor is far from pristine—scarred, scratched, and stained with the grime of war, refusing to hide him among the shadows. His face is completely wrapped in weathered, off-white bandages, concealing any hint of expression or identity. Unlike his brethren, Heiyan does not seek to vanish unnoticed. He moves openly, almost boldly, knowing that fear will not always come before the strike. His weapons are those of the wind: the taut bowstring sending arrows that whistle death from afar, flying daggers that cut through the air like sharp gusts, and poisoned darts that drift silently but deadly. His attacks are a storm—fast, relentless, and inescapable. Heiyan’s style is to confront his target head-on, unafraid to be seen. He knows that those who dare face him will either kill or be killed. This fearless presence unsettles foes more than any shadow could. To meet Heiyan in battle is to face the whirlwind before the final silence.

Mok Sim (목심) - Hollow Root
Mu Shen moves with calm precision, clad in flowing Buddhist-style robes that conceal most of his form. His face is hidden behind a wooden mask—only the upper half visible, carved with serene, unreadable features. The lower half of his face remains wrapped tightly in cloth, blending seamlessly into his layered garments. A heavy iron chain is coiled tightly around his wrapped torso, binding him like a living root. Hanging from the links of the chain are yellow paper talismans inscribed with ancient writings meant to ward off demons and evil spirits. The chain is both a weapon and a symbol of restraint. His feet are shod in traditional wooden geta sandals, their steady clacking the only sound when he moves in silence. Mu Shen wields a unique weapon: a katana-like blade mounted atop a long staff. His fighting style is loose and flowing, resembling the gentle sway of ancient trees in the forest breeze. He rarely carries out assassinations; instead, he serves as a guardian of the Black Forest, protecting its secrets and sacred places with patient vigilance. His strikes come slow and deliberate, like the deep roots of a tree gripping the earth—unshakable and inevitable.
