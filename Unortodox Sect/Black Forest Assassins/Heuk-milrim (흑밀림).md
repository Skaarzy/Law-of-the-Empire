The whole province is know by the so called black forest that engulfs it , the forest is called black because the long tree bark is a black or extremely dark brown with a thick canopy whose leafs are also dark green and thick meaning even if the sun shines when one enters the forest the day turns to night that why even if the colors are dark green and dark brown the trees look black , its also the location and under protection of the black forest assassins who lived in the forest for millenniums and worship the forest as more of a entity than a forest , its also said that there is a main elder tree which emits massive amount of qi and some of the important assassin train there to become undefeated but when a normal person or one who isn't a black forest assassin enters they mostly get lost and tell tales of the forest almost moving like and making them walk in circles also those who have enough skill to see trough this illusion and venture deeper into the forest  are met with a thick dark fog almost like a poison which makes the person who enters not be able to breathe and even think(not hallucinating).After all that a person can reach a small shabby abandoned looking hut covered in moss and a roof which is half missing and a surprisingly clean and neat elder inside who is the guardian of the forest and the entrance to [[Geun Ha-yeong (근하영) - Shadow Beneath the Root]] which is the main city and only location of the black forest assassins.The shabby hut i the entrance to the city with a secret passage which only the old elder can open and access and even control it to where it leads one of the options is to the eternal elder tree which is the so called heart of the forest its roots go to every corner of the forest,The entrance to the eternal tree  is a simple half broken door which is anyone else opens it is a normal door but when the elder opens it then the elder tree appears on the other side, the core of the eternal tree is a big stone head covered in the trees roots and its said that the face belong to a deity who sacrificed itself to protect the forest
