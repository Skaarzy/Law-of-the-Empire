Grandmother Ash (灰婆, Huī Pó) – A frail old woman whose touch drains life force, leaving victims as withered husks, and she isn't actually immortal only because of her life force drain technique can she live forever.Her appearance is of a old thin woman who looks frail but she can transform herself with her life force drain technique to make herself younger.Grandmother Ash (灰婆, Huī Pó) is desperate and terrified beneath her ancient exterior. She's not evil by nature - she's a survivor clinging to existence through horrific means. Every drain is accompanied by rising horror at what she's become, but the terror of death always wins. She lives in scalding caves that act like her life support system. The extreme environment means she's essentially trapped - she literally can't survive in normal conditions anymore. When disciples fail to enter her cave, their bodies implode into mist, which shows how brutal her world is. Born to outcasts who died after her birth, she grew up alone, starving, and eventually deaf and mute from illness. She was literally reaching for bugs to eat when she found the ancient life-stealing scriptures. Her first drains were small - cave creatures, lost explorers - each time accompanied by horror but undeniable relief. The key moment: when a shaman called her a monster, she didn't just drain him for survival - she consumed him entirely in desperate rage. The rush was overwhelming. She felt her skin smooth, hair darken, eyes spark with youth. It was terrifying and exhilarating. This is when she realized she could live eternally young by destroying others. She can control her drain perfectly - from a slight touch to instant obliteration. But she's still bound by the need to drain, which drives her constant desperation. She secretly yearns to break free from this limitation and achieve true immortality.
Her teaching method is brutal - disciples learn through letters or die. But some do succeed, proving her methods work. She embraces "Grandmother Ash" because it captures her perfectly: ancient, mockingly maternal, leaving only dust behind.
