Lady Pung-u (풍우) — The Nature Spirit , deity of nature,animals and birth

Clad in flowing robes that ripple like a gentle breeze, Lady Pung-u moves with the grace of a bird in flight. Her serene white mask, adorned with delicate feather-like patterns, hides an enigmatic gaze that observes the world with quiet wisdom. She is calm and composed, yet ever curious—like the wind that shifts direction without warning, she is unpredictable but never cruel.
As the divine herald, she carries whispers and secret messages across the lands, guiding those who seek truth . She is also honored as the silent breath that brings souls into the world—the unseen wind that stirs just before a newborn’s first cry. Lady Pung-u is gentle and patient, a listener who understands the language of silence and subtlety. Though elusive, she inspires hope and courage in those burdened by secrets or longing for liberation.
Her presence is both soothing and stirring, like the breeze before a storm—capable of calming the restless or awakening the hidden spirit within.
