The Twin Goddesses Wol-hwa(월화) and Seong-un(성운) The Deity Sisters of Time Memory and Dreams

Wol-hwa and Seong-un are twin goddesses who drift silently through the flow of time. Shrouded in twilight-colored robes, their appearance is ghostlike and distant—one veiled in soft moonlight, the other lit with drifting starlight. 
Wol-hwa governs Memory and the Past, keeper of forgotten names and ancient sorrows. Her breath stirs old ruins and echoes through ancestral prayers.  
Seong-un guides Dreams and What Is Yet to Be, whispering to prophets, artists, and fools alike. Her steps leave no mark, but shape what follows.
Together, they govern Time, not as rulers, but as witnesses—watching all rise, all fade, and all return.
