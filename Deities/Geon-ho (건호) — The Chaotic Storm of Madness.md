Geon-ho (건호) The Chaotic Storm of Madness The Divine Guardian of Chaos, Madness, and Change

Geoon-ho is a towering, broad-shouldered giant whose chiseled muscles and imposing stature immediately command respect and awe. His long black hair and thick beard frame a face marked by sharp features and cold, golden eyes that seem to pierce through the soul with unyielding intensity. Draped in a loose robe that reveals a single armored shoulder, he carries himself with the weight of a seasoned warrior and a divine enforcer of chaos. His deep, resonant voice echoes like thunder, calm one moment and roaring the next, reflecting the volatile and unpredictable nature of his divine domain. Jianhao is a man of few words, often stern and cold, but beneath his icy exterior lies a mind ever shifting with the tides of madness and change. He can move swiftly from detached contemplation to fierce wrath, embodying the very essence of chaos — unrestrained, relentless, and impossible to predict. Though he appears ruthless, there is a strict order in his chaos, a purpose behind his madness, making him both a terrifying force and a necessary catalyst for transformation. Those who meet him are often unsettled not just by his power but by the restless storm of his ever-changing spirit.His weapon is double chained small like cut long-sword (like the one of The Stone Pillar, Gyomei Himejima but 2 sword) he uses them either recklessly or precisely it seems like the would be impossible to handle but he uses them with ease like they were a part of him , his power is his rage and chaos like qi which when he releases makes him go berserk but also invincible when in that state its said he could destroy universes.
