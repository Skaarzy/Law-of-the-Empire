Buddha — The Enlightened One, Deity of Wisdom, Compassion, and Liberation

Buddha is a timeless spiritual entity embodying ultimate wisdom, compassion, and liberation from suffering. Neither born nor mortal, he exists beyond the cycle of birth and death, a radiant presence of pure enlightenment that guides lost souls toward awakening.
His form is serene and radiant, often depicted in calm meditation or standing in grace, he chosses to look like a child because its the most smiple and pure form of the human symbolizing perfect balance and inner peace. Buddha’s presence dispels ignorance and fear, illuminating the path to spiritual freedom with unshakable clarity.Enemies in his presence may feel their aggression fade. Rage becomes sorrow. Power becomes stillness. Illusions crack. Truth surfaces. Cultivators with unstable minds may fall into deep reflection or be forced to confront their inner demons.
Worshipped as the divine embodiment of truth, Buddha watches over the realms of spirit and mind, judging not with wrath, but with infinite mercy and understanding. Those who seek his guidance find strength to overcome darkness within themselves and the world.When he is in his child form his power is sealed and he doesn't use it he can still do thing with the child form power like telekinesis and summing or telephoning himself , but when he unseales his ultimate form he become the ultimate buddha who looks like the last pic , his power is the power of Emptiness,  Liberation a divine force that erases suffering, dissolves energy, and returns all things to silence and truth. His power does not destroy; it unburdens. It strips away the false, the clinging, the violent leaving only clarity. Floating gently behind Buddha in a perfect orbit are round, glowing golden spheres each inscribed with a single word or sutra character — concepts like _Silence_, _Compassion_, _Truth_, _Release_, _Mercy_, or _Void_. They rotate slowly around him in a luminous halo, like a sun broken into divine thoughts. Their surface glows with a warm, otherworldly gold, casting soft light wherever he goes. Each sphere is more than just a symbol it is a _manifestation of a spiritual law_. When he activates them:
"Silence" causes sound and qi to vanish in an area.
"Compassion" purifies poison or mental affliction.  
"Truth" dispels illusions or lies.
"Void" erases attacks, severing the energy behind them. A single raised hand can stop raging storms, nullify violent qi, or still time for those around him. He doesn’t resist attacks he simply renders them meaningless.
