Known for his boisterous laughter and carefree demeanor, he moves through towns and festivals with infectious energy, drawing people into celebration and revelry.

His presence is a reminder that life’s greatest gifts are found in joyous freedom and the bonds formed along the way. An older, stout man who appears unexpectedly at a lively city festival. His carefree extroversion and loud merriment draw attention naturally, making him a memorable figure among the crowd. Though he seems like just a jovial wanderer,and a old drunk he is far more — a deity cloaked in the guise of a common man, traveling unnoticed among mortals.He is unlike other deities because he like to wander around and have fun and drink but he is still as powerful as the other deities.Somewhat of a sassy older man as well.Also the father of the Heavenly demon ,

Player can meet him : 

At the bustling city festival, outside a small tavern, a few tables were set up along the street with simple wooden chairs and barrels of drink. One table, small and humble, held five chairs, and around it sat some local villagers laughing heartily and passing cups back and forth. Among them was an old, stout man with a round face, wearing simple but well-worn clothes. He laughed louder than most, a little too loud perhaps, and drank deeply from a half-empty barrel resting on the table. Two other barrels stood by the side, clearly empty but still close enough to suggest he had been drinking for quite some time.
Then, as the main character’s eyes drifted away—drawn by the clamor of the festival or a colorful dancer—the old man suddenly vanished. Not a trace of him remained. The barrels stayed, and the locals continued their revelry as if the old man had never existed. No one at the table batted an eye; they drank and laughed on, unaware of the mysterious guest who had just disappeared.
