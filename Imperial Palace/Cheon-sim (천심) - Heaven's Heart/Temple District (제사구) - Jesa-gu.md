Houses large temples, shrines, and spiritual institutions alongside **healing temples** (or **sacred infirmaries**) - religious medical facilities where monks and priests provide care through both divine blessing and herbal knowledge. These temple hospitals treat the most desperate cases that regular physicians cannot help.

**Temple Refuge Quarters** provide large shelters for the countless pilgrims, desperate sick, and devout believers who journey here from across the empire. These sacred lodgings offer basic but clean accommodations for those seeking blessings, healing, or spiritual guidance, regardless of their ability to pay.

**Sacred Libraries** store religious texts, prophecies, and ancient wisdom, tended by scholarly monks who copy manuscripts and preserve spiritual knowledge. **Meditation Gardens** offer quiet spaces with fountains and prayer paths where visitors can find peace and contemplate divine mysteries. **Message Boards** throughout the district allow people to post requests for prayers, seek lost companions, or share testimonies of miracles received.

Monks, fortune-tellers, and mystics dwell here in permanent residence, serving the spiritual needs of the empire. The district draws those who are deathly sick and seeking miraculous healing, pilgrims searching for divine blessings or guidance about their fate, and devout believers who come to deepen their faith through prayer and meditation.

The atmosphere is both solemn and hopeful - incense burns constantly from numerous shrines, while the sound of chanting, prayer bells, and whispered supplications fills the air. Oracle chambers host sessions where mystics read fortunes and divine the future, while vendors sell religious items, blessed charms, and offerings. Scribes write prayers for the illiterate.

The district serves as the spiritual heart of the empire, where matters of soul, fate, and divine will take precedence over worldly concerns.
