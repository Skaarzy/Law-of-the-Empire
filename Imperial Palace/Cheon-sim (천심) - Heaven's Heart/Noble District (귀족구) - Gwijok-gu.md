Mansions of nobles, military generals, and honored families surrounded by a high wall that separates this luxurious district from the rest of the city. Heavily guarded with private security forces and district patrols, ensuring the safety and privacy of the empire's elite.

Grand estates with sprawling gardens, ornate courtyards, and multiple buildings house entire noble families and their extensive household staff. Each mansion includes private libraries, ancestral halls, guest pavilions, servants' quarters, noble training grounds for sword practice and archery, and stables for the finest warhorses, hunting dogs, and exotic pets. Military generals who have earned the Emperor's favor maintain fortified residences that double as command centers.

The district features wide, paved boulevards lined with flowering trees, **Family Vaults** providing secure storage for each family's treasures, heirlooms, and accumulated wealth. **Entertainment Halls** serve as private venues for hosting elaborate banquets, performances, and celebrations away from public eyes. **Private Guard Barracks** house the personal security forces employed by each noble family. **Courier Services** handle sensitive noble correspondence with absolute discretion.

**Elite Physicians' Quarters** provide medical care exclusively for the nobility, with skilled doctors trained in treatments using rare herbs and advanced techniques. Exclusive markets sell luxury goods, elegant tea houses facilitate elite business dealings, and private temples serve the spiritual needs of noble families.

The most prestigious location in the empire outside the Imperial Palace itself, where bloodline, military achievement, and imperial favor determine one's right to reside behind the protective walls.
