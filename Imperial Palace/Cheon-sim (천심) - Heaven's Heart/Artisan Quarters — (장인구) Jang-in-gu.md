**Commoner Quarters (민거구 - Min-geo-gu)**

Residential areas for skilled craftsmen, farmers, and laborers of higher quality trades than basic workers. These are the respectable working class - master carpenters, experienced blacksmiths, established weavers, and prosperous farmers who have earned their place through skill and reputation.

The district features mostly well-built houses - sturdy construction reflecting the craftsmanship of their inhabitants. Modest but well-maintained homes line narrow streets, with small workshops attached where artisans practice their trades. The quality construction shows the prosperity and skill of these residents, built to last with proper materials and technique.

The district includes neighborhood schools where children learn reading, writing, and basic arithmetic, local shrines dedicated to patron gods of various trades, and cozy tea houses where residents gather to discuss daily affairs. Several inns provide lodging for traveling merchants and visitors, while taverns serve as social centers where craftsmen unwind after long workdays.

**Local Clinics** provide basic medical care from trained healers who treat common injuries and illnesses - practical medicine for working people, not the elaborate treatments available to nobles. **Small Lending Houses** allow residents to borrow money for purchasing tools, materials, or expanding their workshops, helping skilled workers grow their trades.

The area is often subdivided by trade guilds - the Carpenters' Street, Blacksmiths' Quarter, Weavers' Lane - or organized by family clans who have lived and worked together for generations. Each section maintains its own character and traditions while contributing to the district's overall sense of community and craftsmanship.

Community wells, local markets selling everyday goods, and meeting halls for guild gatherings complete the neighborhood. A respectable district where honest work and skill are valued above wealth or noble birth.
