Where the Emperor and court officials live and where all the treasures of the empire are stored. It's the most heavily guarded place in the entire world, with thousands of elite guards stationed throughout. This is where court meetings are held, laws are decided, and imperial edicts are issued - a highly respected place steeped in centuries of history.

The district features multiple royal gardens with rare flowers and ancient trees, plus a large artificial lake with ornate bridges and pavilions for contemplation. Several grand libraries house imperial records, ancient texts, and scholarly works where court officials spend most of their time studying and debating policy. The **Records Archive** stores all official documents, treaties, tax records, and state secrets in heavily guarded vaults.

At its heart stands the magnificent Great Hall, where the Emperor's golden throne sits elevated above the court floor - this is where formal audiences and state ceremonies take place. The Imperial Barracks house the elite palace guards who sleep, eat, and train within the walls, with dedicated **Guard Training Grounds** for elite guard drills and combat practice. Nearby, the Servants' Quarters accommodate the hundreds of staff who maintain the palace grounds.

The district contains several mansion-style Imperial Guest Houses for visiting dignitaries, plus the special **Crown Prince's Residence** - a separate, elegant compound specifically designed for the heir to the throne. The **Imperial Workshops** house master craftsmen who create exclusive items for the palace - jewelry, weapons, furniture, and ceremonial objects found nowhere else in the empire.

The heavily secured **Imperial Mint** produces the empire's currency under the watchful eyes of guards and imperial overseers, ensuring the purity and authenticity of every coin. The **Imperial Treasury** with its multiple vaults, **Ancestral Shrine**, **Imperial Kitchen Complex**, and **Court Physician's Quarters** complete the complex.

The whole place functions like a city within a city - completely separated from the rest of the empire despite being at its very center.

Also in Part 1 and 2 it had  **Court Astrologer's Observatory** - for reading omens and advising on auspicious dates but that was destroyed after the separation of the sect and replaced with a Buddhist temple with a golden Buddha place inside it
