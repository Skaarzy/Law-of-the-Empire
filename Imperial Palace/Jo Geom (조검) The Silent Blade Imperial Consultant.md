**Jo Geom** (조검) - The Silent Blade
_승지_ (Seungji) Royal Secretary   (1276 - 1504)
Died: 1504 (killed in rebellion)

**Role:** Imperial Consultant, Sword Saint, Assistant to the Emperor  
**Appearance:** Zhao Jian carries himself with the grace of a true master. His long, thin sword, both elegant and flexible, is his constant companion. The blade bends with an almost unnatural fluidity, allowing him to create wind and air slashes or to twist it around his opponent’s weapons. His attire is simple yet refined, matching his formal role as the emperor's assistant. Though he exudes a quiet composure, his eyes reflect a deep intelligence and focus, always alert and calculating. Zhao Jian’s movements are deliberate and precise, a reflection of both his martial prowess and disciplined mind.

**Personality:** Zhao Jian maintains a formal and stiff demeanor when in the presence of the emperor or during official matters. As the emperor’s assistant, he understands the gravity of his role, and his words are always measured, his actions deliberate. His formality is a sign of his respect for the throne and his sense of duty, often acting as a voice of reason when others may not have the courage to speak up. However, when away from the emperor or in more casual settings, Zhao Jian sheds his rigid exterior, revealing a calmer, more approachable side. His usual formalities are replaced by a more relaxed, even gentle, nature. He’s a man who listens more than he speaks, and his calm demeanor makes him a steady presence for those around him.

Though loyal to the emperor, Zhao Jian’s position allows him the rare privilege of acting as an adversary to the throne when necessary. He does not hesitate to challenge the emperor’s ideas or decisions if he believes it to be in the empire’s best interest. His ability to speak candidly on behalf of the emperor allows him to serve as an important intermediary, helping to balance royal orders with the broader needs of the empire. This nuanced position has earned him respect, and at times, even fear—though he is more often seen as a wise advisor who helps guide the emperor’s hand with careful counsel.

**Abilities and Martial Arts:** Zhao Jian’s sword, long and thin, is an extension of his focused and strategic nature. His swordsmanship is based on flexibility, allowing him to use his weapon as both a tool of precision and a means of manipulating the flow of battle. His ability to bend the blade and create wind or air slashes gives him a unique edge, as he can use the environment to his advantage, directing air currents to disarm or strike his foes. In combat, Zhao Jian is not only quick and dexterous but incredibly patient, waiting for the perfect opening to deliver a decisive blow.

As an Imperial Consultant and assistant to the emperor, his martial arts are always secondary to his duties. However, when called upon to fight, his swordsmanship reflects a deep understanding of both his opponent and his surroundings. He is more than just a consultant—he is a warrior who has honed his skills to near perfection, and his calm, methodical nature makes him a formidable adversary when the time comes.
