Yan Baihu was a general of a famous battalion under the rule of qin emperor.This battalion was under special orders to go around the country and defend villages and small cities from bandits and people influenced by demons.They were powerful and strategically smart, baihu as a young general was merciless and unpredictable yet many of his men respected him because he always put himself at the front line with other soldiers.When he was young he didn't have much control over himself and was known to get drunk and angry when he was not in the battlefield.But after many battles and many scars he earned himself the title of Grand General which gives him control over more than one battalion , and a estate in the main capital of the empire [[Cheon-sim (천심) - Heaven's Heart]] .After all that baihu still felt incomplete and empty when he came back from battlefields.A Couple of years after the war ended he retired and gave all of his honorary things like the estate and title away and, went to search for something to fill that emptiness.He roamed the empire for 3 years and then deep in a mountain one day he stumbled on the great white tiger the protector of the mountain .He and the tiger fought and chased each other around the mountain for two weeks until baihu won.Nobody know how he won or even why he continued to fight.After he won he stayed at that mountain and is said that he achieved immortality there.For years on after that he protected that whole mountain and made it his own ,not as a ruler but a guardian .Everybody knew when they came to that mountain they should be wary of baihu but nobody knew why he was protecting the mountain.The name of the mountain is [[Baek Ho-san (백호산) - White Tiger Mountain]].When he was a young general he use a Guandao as his weapon the later after he defeated the white tiger he started using his hands and dual Kamas which simple and made for farming but where deadly when used in battle.After he became immortal he began to use martial arts and made his own techniques which none other know and are unique and considered almost god like . After the white tiger died and baihu became the mountains protector things changed for the better but the original rules still applied, just now it was baihu that was upholding them the only difference is that he built himself a house and everybody knew where he was staying so they could ask for help or advice.He himself was known to visit the villages regularly even if it wasn't delivering meat or helping villagers.
