_금위대장_ (Geumwi Daejang) Commander of the Imperial Guards (1264 - 1514)
Died: 1514 (struggle against the corrupt officials)

**Role:** Imperial Commandant, Guardian of the Emperor  
**Appearance:** Wang Zhen’s imposing figure is balanced by an easygoing charm. With a rugged, unkempt look—his hair often a little messy and his armor practical but unpolished—he has the air of someone who doesn’t put too much stock in formalities. Despite his casual, almost carefree appearance, his presence demands attention, especially when he wields his massive dadao, a thick, wide blade that fits his larger-than-life personality.

**Personality:** Wang Zhen is an extroverted, larger-than-life personality with a constant energy that can lift any room. Though his role as the Imperial Commandant is one of responsibility and discipline, he doesn’t let it weigh him down. Instead, he’s known for his infectious laughter, quick wit, and a love for joking around, even in the most serious situations. He’s the kind of person who’s always ready to crack a joke or lighten the mood, and his presence brings a sense of ease to those around him. His personality is warm, brimming with confidence and a carefree attitude that puts others at ease, though it sometimes leads to his being seen as unrefined or a bit too informal for his position.

Wang Zhen doesn’t concern himself with stiff protocols and formalities. He’s not one to stand on ceremony, often showing up to important events with little regard for tidiness or perfect manners—he’s the kind of person who’ll chuckle at his own mess. Despite his lack of concern for appearances, his loyalty and sense of duty to the emperor are ironclad. He’ll fight tooth and nail to protect the throne and those he cares about, and his larger-than-life personality masks an unshakable resolve.

**Abilities and Martial Arts:** Wang Zhen is a true powerhouse, known for his thunderous fighting style. His weapon of choice, the dadao, a large and thick blade, is an extension of his personality—intimidating, blunt, and impossible to ignore. His martial arts style reflects his straightforward and bold nature, focusing on overwhelming force and overpowering opponents with sheer strength. His thunder techniques add a devastating element to his attacks, capable of generating powerful electric strikes and defensive shockwaves that disorient and disable enemies.

While his thunder abilities are powerful, Wang Zhen's greatest strength lies in his defense. He is an impenetrable wall, able to withstand an incredible amount of damage and shield those under his protection with his indomitable will. Whether it’s standing firm in battle or using his blade to deflect strikes, his primary goal is always to defend—his striking power comes secondary to his protective nature. In battle, he’s a one-man shield, ensuring the safety of the emperor, even at the cost of his own well-being.

**Role in the Empire:** As the Imperial Commandant, Wang Zhen is the emperor’s personal guardian, his first line of defense. Though his humor and carefree attitude might seem out of place in such a serious role, Wang Zhen is a master at balancing the two sides of his personality. His loyalty to the throne and his ability to protect the emperor at all costs make him indispensable. He’s seen as the empire’s impenetrable shield, able to shrug off danger with a smile while using his overwhelming strength and defensive capabilities to keep his charge safe.

Despite his playful nature, Wang Zhen commands the respect of his peers and soldiers alike, all of whom understand that beneath the jokes and laughter is a warrior who will stand firm when it matters most. He is the protector who never hesitates to laugh in the face of danger but will do anything to ensure the safety of those he is sworn to defend.
